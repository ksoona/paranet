He sensed that the other abductees were being "accessed" by the  
aliens by some means and were being asked many of the same   questions
as himself.  The subject also sensed DS92007PH, who was in   a
different location from himself and from the other abductees.   He
could "feel" the aliens trying to "access" her mind to retrieve  
information.  A debate seemed to be taking place among the aliens as
to   whether the "experiment/project" should be allowed to continue or
if it   had been compromised by the recent events (abductees knowing
of   their abductions and meeting together).  
 
Accusations were made about "improper procedures being followed by  
the "Grays" and "Browns."  At one point, when DS92002DM   "sensed/saw"
the other abductees as they were being accessed by the   aliens, he
had the thought that the other abductees "don't know there   are
others there."  
 
This thought caught the attention of the human who seemed surprised  
that the subject was picking up on their activities.  Immediately, two
"Grays" entered the room and took hold of the subject's hands and he
was unable to "pick up anything further of the alien thoughts or  
questioning."   
 
At this point another of Derrel Sims' hypnotic suggestions activated  
itself with the subject with interesting results which we are unable
to   report at this time as further investigation and experimentation
are   continuing.  
 
One of the more interesting aspects of this case, and one which is
being   looked into further, pertains to a question asked of subject
DS92002DM   by the aliens.  At one point he was asked what he knew
about a   government project called "Project Prometheus."  Although
the subject   had no knowledge of such a project, we are researching
the matter.  
 
As the meeting seemed to be ending, the human asked the subject what  
he "would like to do," to which the subject responded that he would
like   to go with them (a suggestion even he finds bizarre).  The
subject was   told that this was "impossible" as he was "contaminated"
(the subject   did not feel this implied physically).   
 
The human then took him into a side room where he was shown a  
"strange sort of chart or diagram" which he did not understand and was
unlike any he'd ever seen before.  He then was led by the two
"Browns"   through several other rooms to another examination
room/laboratory   where a nasal implant was placed in his nostril (the
one later removed).    The subject was then given his pajamas, told to
dress, and returned to   his home and bed.  
 
Subjects DS92009LT and DM92003JA were also hypnotized and   reported
being abducted on December 8, and being in a room with   others.   
 
Subject DS92034LC had conscious memories of being in the room on  
that night.   
 
All three of these subjects have independently described the room, its
appearance, and individuals in the room.  All of the subjects'  
descriptions are similar and details of the room match--including
several   unique aspects unheard of in other cases.   
 
It is interesting to note that all of the abductees in the "group room
experiences" perceived events differently although parallel.  One  
believed she had died and was with her dead brother (who had strange  
eyes).  One thought she was with God whose face she couldn't see  
because of a fog that only allowed her to see his shape.  All of the  
individuals reported themselves and others in the room as being nude. 
 
One abductee who felt hungry was told they would be fed was handed  
silverware as though they were about to be served food.  When she  
was told to look at the silverware under hypnosis, it was not
silverware   at all but some strange objects she could not identify.  
 
Each of the abductees in the "group room experience"  seemed to be in 
a drugged or hallucinative state.  This condition seemed to alleviate
when they were taken to another room for examinations and nasal and 
ocular implants.   
 
Other abductees also have reported supporting events and experiences.   
The total number of abductees involved in the event is not known for  
sure.   
 
Great care was taken in the early stages of the investigation to
ensure   that subjects were unaware of the others' events. It was only
after   hypnosis, with similar descriptions of events and locations by
five   different individuals (each unaware of any other abductee
reporting   anything) that information concerning the event was
released.    Numerous descriptions and minute details have been
deliberately left   out of this report, as investigations are still
ongoing.   
 
The significance of this event cannot be overlooked. It would appear  
that the implants were deliberately placed in the abductees before the
HUFON meeting and removed the day after.  Whether the aliens knew  
about the meeting or had simply implanted the abductees with the
intent   of monitoring a gathering of abductees is unknown.   However,
for the   first time within the history of the abduction phenomenon,
the   abductees seem to have captured the attention of the abductors. 
 
Although we do not know the outcome of these events we hope that it  
may lead to a breakthrough in communication, improvement in  
relationship with the aliens, and an end to abductions and  
experimentation on unwilling subjects.
