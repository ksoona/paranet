Subject: Victor 1 Where Are You?
  
  The space craft that Val Thor has on Lake Mead is parked in a certain
place. Here is some information about it;..............................
    Parked near the shore of the western-most reach of Lake
Mead, east of Las Vegas, Nevada, is VICTOR ONE, a space-
craft from an extraterrestrial culture in which the name 
Commander Valiant Thor is prominent. This is the craft
which he commands and uses as his "home" on Earth. VIC-
TOR ONE is northwest of Hoover Dam, southeast of Nellis 
Air Force Base, northeast of the town of Henderson, Nevada,
and south of the Gypsum Plant. As of early December, 1988,
it was just south of Las Vegas Wash about a mile northeast of 
the junction of Highways 147 and 166. It can move about. 
VICTOR ONE  has been in this vicinity for eleven years.
There are other Victor Class spacecraft which have been 
observing Earth for thousands of years. Several thousand peo-
ple of Earth know of VICTOR ONE...approximately 2000
are U.S. Government officials currently in office. A limited 
number of people of Earth have visited VICTOR ONE,
including several scientists. No government officials have ever
visited VICTOR ONE.

                  The "Victor Class" Sector

   A space craft of the Victor Class is a 300-foot diameter
discus, twenty-two feet high at the rim, increasing to ninety-
seven feet on the axis. The permanent crew is approximately 
200. Its audio-visual-laser-type camera can select and pick up
any person's actions and words as well as record them, all this 
up to a distance of 1200 miles from the spacecraft. There are
presently about 450 persons under surveillance by VICTOR 
ONE.  Only 20% are of a positive nature.  The rest present 
some kind of threat to the planet.

   Approximately 103 victor Class spacecraft are on or near
the surface of the Earth, active between some 287 locations
The first Victor Class ship visited Earth nearly 6,000 years
ago.  When Albert Einstein's four papers of technical develop-
ment first appeared in 1905, the need for close scrutiny
incresed. Deployment reached the present level of 103 in 
1981 during the peak threat of neclear war.

   All of e Victor Class ships were carefuly constructed 
on board the Starship. There is a level compartment on the 
very bottom of the Starship where these ships are constructed
and housed until they are dispatched. The crews are carefully
chosen with the ranking officers being those who are consid-
ered seasoned to command such a craft.  The design of the 
Victor Class ships is constant.  There are no variations. There 
are other scout ships that are smaller (such as the one which
Val used to go to Alexandria, Virginia and visit the Pen-
tagon). These have a capacity of one, two, three, four, six,
eight or ten persons.  All of these are also constructed of the 
same basic material as the Victor Class ships. The shapes vary.
As a mater of fact they have been built in every shape
known to man.  A mini-class ship with an elongated 
configuraton in shape of a torpedo is used to transport
supplies. These are those which have been seen coming out 
of the sides of mountains in California, Nevada and Arizona.
Bases inside these mountain areas house these craft as well.
You may have heard some of the stories the Indians tell of 
these bases.

   All of the Victor Class ships have the capability of inter-
planetary travel if and when it's necessary.

JW I would like to go into this craft someday.
