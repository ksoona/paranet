G'day ALL,

I am one of the sysops from 1:141/322 and I am an Australia.  When I did my bit
in the military (CAD) I was employed as an AWACS Tech.  (That is a fancy way of
saying I sat in the back of a C-130 and stared at radar screens)... 

What I wanted to mention is that UFO in the strict sense of the word is a
frequent identifier of "things" that appear out of the night (and sometimes
day) often.  We would variously have ovals appear on our screens (usually as
oval and therefore "safe") and sometimes they would appear, go bat-wing, and
then vanish.  Some behaved like AtA missles and were logged as such.  But  then
there were some that didn't behave like any type of aircraft or weapon that we
knew of... Those were written up as well, but listed as 103's (which means
basically a Unidentified Balistic Contact).  We were not encouraged  to discuss
these "things" and in the way that the paperwork was explained, it tends to
lead one to think that because the paper work is there, then the gov't expects
that these types of things happen... And as one airman put it, "ahh, it is just
a test vehicle or some thing..."

Unlike the reports here, we never actually had visual on any of these targets
so it's your guess what they were.
