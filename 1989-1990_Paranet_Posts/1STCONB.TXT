Yes, but stage two was not implemented on your planet in the same way
because of your psychological make-up.

         Stage one is still one of the most important phases going on.
         Did these people have drearns? What did they experience in their
         internal world?

Their dreams did not display alien creatures. Instead, their dreams
had emotional content that went beyond what they were used to. They
were filled with symbology. For instance, a dream may have an
individual flying through the stars. Perhaps they come face to face
with someone while they are flying. (These are very simple examples.)
The person they contact in the dream will look like their own species.
There is no sense of alienness. The alienness that you feel on your
world is a reflection of the alienness you feel between each other.
The inhabitants of Alpha-3 did not start out feeling there is anything
"alien" going on.

         So they were not a people who experienced alienation amongst
         themselves?

Correct

         Did they experience astral travel to other planets or realms?

Yes, but it was all within the context of their own reality structure,
so it never seemed alien.

         Did they experience astral travel from ETs into their dream
         worlds?

Technically yes, but they had no way of knowing they were aliens.

         During stage one, did the manifestation of astral contact take
         on a different theme?

Yes. The flavor of the astral contact in stage one began to
demonstrate clearly and directly the idea of life and consciousness
external to their world structure -- not alien, but external.

         So the boundaries of their world simply expanded?

Exactly.

         Did their stage-one experiences synchronize smoothly with the
         visual sightings of craft in stage two?

Yes. Within stage one the species first began with more abstract ideas
of contact, which then filtered down into the physical realiy. For
instance, in your society it would be translated as having books and
movies that dealt in a positive, expanding way with the subject
matter. During 50 to 100 years of this, the species then adopted a
belief system that this was natural. Therefore, the first actual
physical sightings in stage two were not a source of shock but a
natural progression. They were also a source of great excitement.

         So when they saw them, it was more a reaction of familiarity.

Exactly.

         Did Alpha-3 have members of their own society who func-
         tioned as sociologists or philosophers who interpreted this
         phenomenon ?

They had members of their society --sociophilosophers, if you wish to
call them that--who talked about the expanding boundaries of their
society, but did not talk about these ships as meaning something
symbolically. That would have meant the ships were outside of their
reality. The ships were not alien. It was not like looking at
something that seemingly doesn't belong and trying to figure it out,
like your society does. The process was so natural and gradual that
there was no reason to philosophize about it.

         So the reason we try to interpret it is because we deny it.

Exactly. You see it as something unnatural. You see it as an aspect of
your reality that is alien. It is the same reason why you attempt to
interpret your dreams. You see your dreams as being alien to who you
are.

         So maybe an integral idea of helping us to explore this is to ex-
         amine the idea of interpretation. We seem to be interpreting
         everything we come across. Are you saying that these people did
         not interpret their experience?

Correct. They did not question it, because it did not exist outside of
them.

         In stage two, when they saw these ships in the sky, did they
         know there were people inside who were from another planet?

Yes. Absolutely no question. It was accepted.

         Were they curious about it? Did they want to meet them?

They were curious and excited. There were times of celebration when
these ships would appear--not because they saw these ships as superior
