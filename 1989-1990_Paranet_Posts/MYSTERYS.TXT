                   GEOLOGICAL MYSTERY LIES DEEP BELOW STATE


                           By Klark of the Kent Team


Deep, very deep, in the heart of South
Georgia, miles beneath the tiny
crossroads town of Surrency, lies a
mysterious, newly discovered geologic
formation never detected anywhere else
in the world.

Geologists say the "Surrency Bright
Spot," nine miles beneath South
Georgia's piney woods, may be an
ancient reservoir of water or other
fluid formed more than 200 million
years ago by the collision of North
Africa and North America.

"Its big and we've never seen anything
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------






like it before," says Dr. Larry Brown,
an associate professor of geological
sciences at Cornell University, who
was part of a scientific team that
discovered the formation.

Brown, a director of the Cornell-based
Consortium for Continental Reflective
Profiling (COCORP), which is
developing a detailed picture of the
Earth's mantle, says the formation -
"bright" only in terms of the way it
reflects sound waves - is about two
miles in diameter and appears to be
shaped like a contact lens.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If it is a subterranean pool of water
or other fluid, it could force
physicists to revise models of the
Earth's crust.  Until now many of them
felt the heat and pressure at those
depths were too great for fluids to
exist.

Nine miles down, temperatures are
nearly 500 degrees Fahrenheit and
pressures are great enough to flatten
the sturdiest truck like a pancake.

"We really don't have a good idea what
the object the formation is composed
of," says Brown.  "If it is water, it
would upset a lot of scientific
theories and it would cause us to
rethink our ideas about the role of
water in forming the Earth's mantle."

Brown says it might be a liquefied
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gas, such as carbon dioxide or
methane, or something more exotic,
such as liquid helium.  But he says
because of the tremendous pressure and
temperature, it is probably not oil.
Even if it were, it would be
impossible to recover from such a
depth, miles deeper than the deepest
oil well.  Surrency Mayor Stanford
Tillman, first informed of the unique
geologic feature last week, has his
own theory.

"It might have something to do with
Surrency's ghost," he says.  "If this
town is known for anything, its for
the ghost that supposedly haunted the
old Surrency house owned by the family
for whom the town is named during the
1870's and 1880's."

Tillman says inhabitants of the house
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
reported dishes flying off shelves,
logs jumping off the fire and bricks
coming through the walls.  The "ghost"
became so famous that people rode the
train from Atlanta just to see the
"haunted" house, which burned down at
the turn of the century.

"A lot of us also suspect that the
goings-on had something to with
unusual magnetic activities in our
area," says Tillman.  "The discovery
of this object formation is very
exciting to me."

Brown's interest in the discovery is
of a more scientific nature.  The
geologists were looking for the long-
sought "suture" between the North
African and North American continents
when they got the first hint of the
existence of a massive formation in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1985.  Recent tests confirmed the
existence of the "bright spot" and
Brown says details will be published
soon in a scientific journal.

"Finding the suture between the
continents was exciting, but the fact
that we found this bright spot is even
more exciting," says Brown.

The discovery is part of an ongoing
effort to develop a detailed picture
of the Earth's crust, which extends 20
miles below the planet's surface.  The
scientists beam sound waves deep
underground.  When they are reflected
back to the surface, they are recorded
on a graph, giving scientists an idea
of the formations far below.  The
system helped to determine that the
suture between North Africa and North
America runs in a broad, gentle arc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from Brunswick through Americus and on
to the Alabama border.

About 500 million years ago, the two
continents collided, forming the
Appalachian Mountains.  When they
pulled apart 180 million years ago, a
piece of North Africa remained lodged
against North America, a continental
fragment that now is beneath Florida
and South Georgia.  Sometime during
that collision, geologists say, water
or some other fluid may have trickled
deep into the zone between the
continents, forming the Surrency
Bright Spot.

                 -=-

I would like to remark on two
interesting  points in regard to this
article.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first is in regard to the Hollow
Earth theory.  The observation was
that it was 9 miles down, at 500
degrees Fahrenheit and (according to
modern theories) subjected to
tremendous pressures.

In regard to the Hollow Earth theory,
specifically from the book
"Etidorpha", mention is made of a
shell of energy surrounding a central
point.  This shell attracts on both
sides (i.e. from the outside surface
towards it and from the inside surface
towards it).  Matter is aggregated
from space and from within.  The
sphere of energy is hundreds of miles
in diameter inside with a glowing sun
at the centre.  Many  legends speak of
caves and tunnels deep within the
earth leading to Shamballa and
Agharta.  These are where the most
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
advanced of the surface dwellers are
sometimes invited to reside with the
inhabitants who are descendants of
devastated cultures such as the Mayans
and Atlanteans.

The point is that the book Etidorpha
says that there are many entrance
points leading to caves and tunnels
which go almost directly to this
mirror image of the surface.  These
entrance points are many especially in
the Southeastern section of the USA.
At one point in the book, the
travellers crossed a huge lake of very
still water, since there was no wind
to disturb the surface for the
creation of waves.  An unmoving
surface would interestingly enough
reflect sound waves much as the
article mentions.  Very curious,
despite the incredulous reaction of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
those who refuse to look into such
things.

The second observation from this
article is the mention of the "ghostly
happenings" at the turn of the
century.  Aside from the more likely
probability of poltergeist activity
(which in itself might be the same
thing), could this not be the actions
of the "Dero" which Richard Shaver and
Ray Palmer wrote about in the 50's and
60's.  The Dero are the "evil twins"
of the "Tero".  Both are said to be
descended from a race of surface
dwellers who were forced to move
underground when the Sun began giving
off radioactive and deadly radiation.

However, the beneficent radiations
emanating from a normal Sun soon
caused mutations and the spawning of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the Dero.  The Tero were the ones who
managed to remain relatively free of
the mutations but were affected by
sickness and loss of mental ability.

When this race moved underground, they
took with them many of the advanced
machines which were developed on the
surface.  According to Shaver, many of
these devices still work though the
devolved races have forgotten how to
repair those  which  don't.  Many of
the machines are said to project rays
which can affect the minds of people,
teleport, give intense pleasure or
pain, cause levitation or movement
from a distance, etc...  The Dero
delight in the use of such devices to
torment surface dwellers.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of those who buy the Shaver story,
some think that the ray machines could
explain some of the "ghostly
happenings" which have occurred for
centuries all over the world.  Who
knows?  Possibly there is a link with
the article somewhere in all this?

end.
