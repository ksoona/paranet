11.36: North American Circle
-----------------------------
PO Box 61144, Durham, NC 27715-1144

11.37: North American Institute for Crop Circle Research (NAICCR)
------------------------------------------------------------------
NAICCR was formed in 1990 after requests for information about North
American crop circles had reached epidemic proportions.  UFOROM
associates, who had been regularly investigating reports and
discoveries of UGMs (Unusual Ground Markings), including traces very
similar to crop circles, responded to inquiries by formalising a sister
group devoted to research into UGMs.

NAICCR associates investigate UGMs rationally, and prepare reports on
their findings.  NAICCR distributes a list of known North American
UGMs, based on information provided to NAICCR by co-operative
researchers throughout the continent.  A comparable list of British UGMs
has never been available in this manner.  NAICCR also publishes an
annual report of North American UGM activity, with analyses and
commentary.

NAICCR will continue to function in the future at about the present
level of activity, though it would be preferred if UGM cases would
once again be studied as special cases of UFO cases, as was the case
before tthat category of UGMs was raised to a separate category because
of British research.  NAICCR may perhaps merge back with UFOROM, if this
is the case, since UFOROM had been investigating UGMs as a matter of
course.

History
ParaNet started on January 1, 1986 in a bulletin-board system called

Jim Speiser was the Director of ParaNet 1986-88 at the time and
wanted to bring together the three factions of paranormal debate
(the skeptics, the believers, and the undecided) for public
discussion of paranormal. He created ParaNet as neutral ground for
the exchange of information on the paranormal.In 1988 Speiser turned
over the directorship to Michael Corbin. 

Current Status
ParaNet's basic goles are reflected in its motto:  "Answering Questions,
Questioning Answers". ParaNet offers investigator's raw material, in the
form of sighting reports, which comes from data supplied by the public. 
The network concept provides the investigators and its users with immediate,
one-on-one contact, and instant access to a global communications medium.
ParNet also keeps it users informed major, fast-breaking stories involving
the paranormal. ParaNet can be accessed in six countries on three
continents.

The People of ParaNet
ParaNet provides access to experts through their electronic system. Its
research  branch is headed by Robert B. Klinn, a veteran investigator who
worked for the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek. ParaNet also provides a conference
on the UFO abduction experience hosted by Dr. David Jacobs, a UFO historian
and author. Many different groups and researchers of the paranormal use
Parenet for information exchange and discussion of ideas. Among some of them
are the Bay Area Skeptics, the South Shore Skeptics, Marge Christenson,
T. Scott Crain, Dan Drasin, Stan Gordon, Barry Greenwood, Budd Hopkins,
Linda Howe, Phil Imbrogno, Dr. David Jacobs, Dr. Donald Johnson, Philip  
Klass,
Bruce Maccabee, Maj. James McGaha, Dr. Mark Rodeghier, Robert Schaeffer, 
Tracy Torme, and Dr. David Webb, Don Ecker, Vicki Cooper and and many others.

The Future of ParaNet
In the future ParaNet plans to expan their network to even more cournties, 
increasing public education and scientific-oriented  research and 
investigation unequaled in  the field. Their focus will be directed at 
bringing various credible existing organizations from around the world into 
a better orgonized research effort. ParaNet will also turn its attention to 
more investigative  reporting. Paranet plans to acomplish this unser their 
new organization known as  MICAP  (Multi-national Investigations Cooperative 
on  Aerial Phenomena). (see MICAP) MICAP will be a separate non-profit 
research/educational vehicle with investigative ability.

anomalous phenomena and present research results to the scientific and
scholarly community; its members are drawn from practitioners of science
who have acquired a first-hand knowledge and understanding of the
scientific process. The Society holds annual international meetings and
periodically scheduled regional meetings.
To promote co-operation, and to accommodate other levels of activity and
interest, the Society has created the categories of "Corresponding Member"
and "Associate".  "Associates" receive the "Journal of Scientific

11.62: Ufology Research of Manitoba (UFOROM)
--------------------------------------------
UFOROM is a private, non-profit and volunteer organisation which is
involved in rational discourse, investigation and research on UFOs and
related phenomena. It was formed in 1975.  All types of UFO-related
phenomena have been studied by UFOROM, including traces, crash-retrievals,
abductions and cattle mutilations.  In addition, some UFOROM associates
also study fortean and psychic phenomena.  UFOROM publishes an annual
survey of UFO activity in Canada, comparable to the Ferrughelli reports
on American cases.  Case data is provided by co-operative Canadian
researchers across Canada.  

UFOROM is not open to general public membership.  However, independent
investigators and researchers throughout North America and particularly
in Canada are associated with UFOROM by way of their contributions of
case information and data from their own areas.  Such contributions are
welcomed and readily acknowledged by UFOROM.

Although UFOROM does not publish a journal or newsletter for general
distribution, associates frequently exchange information on an informal
basis.  This information is made available through articles and reports
published in UFO magazines or books, written or edited by UFOROM
associates.

UFOROM is associated with an irregular ufozine titled the SWAMP GAS
JOURNAL. [See UFO Publications section]  It is available in hard copy
through zine exchange or for a "cost" of one International Postal Reply
Coupon per issue.  As an experiment, the most recent issue also has
been made available in electronic format via INTERNET by posting a
request to: rutkows@ccu.umanitoba.ca

UFOROM associates are involved with the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO
Studies (CUFOS), the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) and various other
organisations.  UFOROM functions independently, but operates with an
understanding of complete co-operation and information exchange with
interested and serious researchers in their specialised areas of
interest.

UFOROM is devoted to the rational and objective study of UFOs and
related phenomena, as well as other controversial phenomena such as
crop circles.  All views on these phenomena, including both proponent
and contrary standpoints, are considered.  In this regard, UFOROM
associates tend to engage in dialogue with both "believers" and
"debunkers".  It is hoped that such attempts to "bridge the gap"
between the two sides of the debate will encourage more constructive
discourse.

Correspondence for UFOROM can be snailmailed to:

Publishes the UNARIUS Light Magazine since1954.
A non-profit, New Age organization which has pioneered the teaching of Past
Life Therapy since 1954. This teaching is given to the student through a
curriculum that attunes the truth seeker to the high frequency energy
maintained by the authors, who are Advanced Spiritual Beings living on the
Inner Planes. UNARIUS receives most of its information and instructions
through channeling with the Higher Beings (Space Brothers). UNARIUS writes,
publishes, and distributes a complete course of study describing the New
Sciences of Life. This course material is covered over 100-plus texts of
the UNARIUS Academy of Sciences; augmented by over 100 video programs. The
course material covers missing piece's of man's prehistory, the enigma
surrounding the dilemma of unresolved problems in science, politics and
religion, and the future for mankind in the 21st century.
Class sessions are held at the UNARIUS Center on Wednesdays & Sundays at
7:00 p.m.; class fee is S10.00. Some courses are also available on TV
stations throughout California. All of the materials are directly related
to the UNARIUS goal of achieving Higher Awareness.
One of this group's main tenets is that there are superior extraterrestrial
forces which control the Earth's destiny and which know the fate of
mankind. With the teachings provided by UNARIUS, they feel that each person
can become cosmically attuned to higher spiritual forces and can become
aware of Reality and what is in store for humans. UNARIUS teaches that the
Interplanetary Confederation, a coalition of 33 existing planets, is
building 33 spacecraft that will form a giant city and will descend to
Earth in the year 2001. This "building" or "city" will descend on land
purchased for this purpose in the southern California area and will be a
gathering spot for people to come and learn about Cosmic Awareness.
In addition to students, interested parties can join UNARIUS for $50.00 per
year.

History:
        The "Australian Flying Saucer Research Society (Victorian
Branch)" was formed on the 17th of February, 1957 as a branch of the
"Australian Flying Saucer Research Society" and later that year was
reorganised as the "Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society" with
Mr. Peter E. Norris L.L.B. as President. In 1968 the name was again
altered - this time to the "Victorian U.F.O. Research Society".
The current executive has been in place since 1978.
The Society has held a dispassionate attitude on U.F.O.s, claiming
it is a scientific problem deserving closer attention. 
Membership of this Society - which maintains the largest membership
of any U.F.O. organisation in the Southern Hemisphere - is open to
all who are genuinely interested in the subject.

Significant cases studied:
        - The Frederick Valentich disappearance (1978).  Frederick
Valentich was a twenty year old member of the Royal Australian Air 
Force who disappeared on a solo private flight across Bass Strait
after radioing that an object was hovering on top of his Cessna 182.

        - The Knowles Family Encounter.  The case of a family on a
car trip across the Nullarbor Plain in South Australia who were
buzzed by a UFO that at one stage lifted the Knowles car into the
air only to drop it to the road seconds later.
