
   James Gatlin said something or someone killed the goats on his Brindley 
Mountain farm, taking their eyeballs, tongues and sexual organs. 
The mutilations, which occured between Saturday night and Monday afternoon 
near Oden ridge, are the first reported in Morgan County since recent reports 
of similar incidents about 40 miles away in Marshall County. 
Authorities in Morgan County say thcy are investigating and warned farmers to 
keep a close watch on their animals. 
At least 26 animals have been killed and mutilated since October near 
Albertville and other Sand Mountain communities. Cows, goats and at least one 
dog have been found mutilated. Precise, bloodless, almost high-tech surgical 
incisions are the hallmarks of nearly all the killings, officials say, There 
were no tire tracks where the animals were found. 
   The killings apparently are happening at night and all are within 150 feet 
of power lines except Gatlin's, No power lines are near his isolated property. 
   Speculation on the killers ranges from aliens, satanic wor shipers and UFOs 
to people in helicopters or on foot. 
Gatlin said he tries to check on his livestock each day. Besides goats he has 
horses, cows and pigs. He last checked the animals Saturday night.
About 4:30 pm Monday, Gatlin's son found four dead goats scattered about the 
property and notified his father, who lives in Priceville. 
"We called the law and went on and looked" Gatlin said.
They found a fifth goat later near a small pond.  Four others are missing.
"I took my hands and pried one of the mouths open and the tongue was gone,"
Gatlin said.
" All the goats had one eyeball missing - a clean socket left behind.  They 
also had their sexual organs removed but there were no traces of blood.
gatlin picked up one of the dead animals. "You see any blood on that goat? 
Anywhere?" he asked.
He dropped the goat carcass and surveyed the area: "You see, there ain't no 
sign of a struggle."
The carcasses were spread across the property, and Gatlin said whoever killed 
them had to chase them because the goats run from people.  No tire tracks or 
footprints were found near the animals.
He found crumpled brush at one spot inside the fenced pasture.  "It looked 
like a vehicle (was there) but no tracks.  But when it's dry like it has been 
you won't see any tire tracks.  There ain't no dog traks.  It looks like if it 
had been dogs they would have chewed them up a bit.  Nonetheless the goats are 
dead."
Some Marshall County farmers have reported helicopters flying low at night - 
apparently trying to herd the cattle, they said. Some farmers are 
patrolling their land with guns.  According to Ted Oliphant, a Fyffe 
policeman quoted by Cox News Service, 95 percent of the cases have involved 
reports of helicopter sightings, often with red green and white lights 
or blue and white ones. - Last month, Jean Cole, the wife of Albertville 
Chief Detective Tommy Cole, saw a helicopter in their back yard. She saw four 
men in business suits sitting in it. When they saw her, the helicopter 
flew off. The next day, Cole found a black Angus mutilated, its sexual organs 
and rectum removed.
"I've seen many animals killed by predators, and there's always blood around," 
Cole said.  "I've never seen anything like it.  I don't know what it was.  
I've been in the livestock business 35 years.  I've had many, many dead cows 
and bulls, but none like that."
Meanwhile, in Morgan County, Gatlin doesn't know who would want to kill his 
goats or if a satanic cult is behind the mutilations.  He doesn't know anyone 
with a grudge against him and has not had problems with trespassers.
   The goats were valued at about $45 each. One of the goats appeared to have 
a bullet hole in the top of the skull with an exit wound at the base of the 
throat. 
   "But in every one of them - the blood is gone," Gatlin said. "Some body 
might have done it and made it look like these people (satanists) didit."
Morgan County Sheriff's Capt. James Hudson said causes of death are 
undetermined and an investigation continues.  "We just wanted people to be 
aware we have had some in our county."
Hudson doesn't know if the mutilations are linked to those in Marshall County.  
"I have no idea.  I couldn't say that," he said.  "We're talking about 35 or 
40 miles apart I would imagine, if not further.
Morgan County investigators are seeking information from Marshall County 
authorities on their mutilations to help with the Gatlin case, according to 
Hudson. 
  "Predators don't do this," Oliphant said of the Fyffe cases. "And if it was 
a satanic cult, they'd use knives and there'd be blood. They'd do it in 
secrecy and not with high technololy. Everybody wants me to tell them it's a 
satanic cult, because this is the heart of the Bible Belt and they want an 
easy explanation so they can be done with it. They don't want to look at the 
scientific facts. The evidence doesn't lead to that. 
   "We've got more than one group doing this. We've got the unexplained 
events, with high technology, cauterization of wounds- And we've got 
something I can't release right now."
