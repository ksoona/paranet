   In light of the interest I have seen here, elsewhere, and world wide even,
   I tender this suggestion:

  That a consolidation of interested parties apply to the FCC for an uplink to 

  establish a UFO channel on satellite. I'm sure cable companies would carry it
  on demand.

  So, who out there has the weight carry off $uch?
