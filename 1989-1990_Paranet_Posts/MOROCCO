- Economy
Overview: After registering a robust 10% growth in 1988, the
economy slowed in 1989 because of higher prices for food and oil
imports, lower worker remittances, and a trade dispute with India over
phosphoric acid prices that cost Rabat $500 million. To meet the foreign
payments shortfall, Rabat has been drawing down foreign exchange reserves.
Servicing the $22 billion foreign debt, high unemployment, and Morocco's
vulnerability to external forces remain severe problems for the 1990s.
