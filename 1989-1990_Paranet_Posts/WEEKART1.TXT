Temporarily losing my mind yesterday, I sat down and typed the entire
USA Weekend article on alien abductions--just for you.  Applause is
fine this time.  Next time I expect compensation. ;-)

Front cover:  ABDUCTED BY ALIENS?  Thousands of Americans--including
Sky Ambrose--say it has happened to them.  What's up?

by Frank Kuznik

(c) 1993 USA Weekend, a division of Gannett Co., Inc.


Tens of thousands of seemingly ordinary people have a very strange
tale to tell involving spaceships and odd-looking creatures.  Are they
getting carried away?

Skye Ambrose--yes, that was her name before all this started--says it
happened 3 1/2 years ago on a remote, moonlit stretch of Colorado
highway.  Enticed by circular flashing lights in the sky, she and a
friend pulled off Interstate 70, cut the headlights, and then watched
in disbelief as ethereal black waves began to envelop the car.

"Oh my God.  What are those?" Skye said to her friend, who had noticed
something else.

"Look! A falling star." The words were barely out of her mouth before
the star turned into a glowing ball of white light.  It stopped above
a field, hovering no more than 100 feet from the car.  As the women
watched in speechless amazement, two beams of light, brilliant with
pinks, purples and blues, dropped from the ball to form a shimmering
"V".

"You know those people who say they've been kidnapped by a UFO?"
Ambrose said weakly to her friend.  "Well, that's not going to happen
to us.  We're not getting out of this car!"

Suddenly the lights vanished.  All at once, the women felt exhausted
and irritable, their nerves frayed.  A short drive brought them to
Goodland, Kansas, where they found a motel and, inside, unpleasant
surprises in the bathroom mirror.

Ambrose's friend stared in shock at the deep flush tainting her
normally pale complexion.  And Ambrose was equally affected--
colorless and drawn, with her ordinarily curly hair plastered flat
against her head.

But the worst shock came in the morning, when Ambrose looked at a map
and realized that it had taken three hours to drive the 72-mile leg
of the trip on which they had seen the UFO.  Even with the stop for
the encounter, that left nearly two hours unaccounted for.  Where had
they gone?

By any rational measure, the idea is absurd:  aliens kidnapping people
to take them aboard flying saucers for bizarre experiments.  Space
creatures used to be the stuff of tabloid headlines, and still are: 
A recent "Weekly World News" ran the story "Hillary Clinton adopts
alien baby"--with a photo.  But these days you can spot aliens, or at
least serious discussions of them, everywhere from the office of a
Harvard psychiatrist to high-rated network miniseries.  They are the
subject of talk shows, best-selling books and scholarly debate at
symposiums--and sometimes they're as close as the neighbor down the
street, people like 45-year-old Skye Ambrose.  She is to speak July
17-18 at the Seattle UFO Research Conference.  Sample topics: 
"Multiple Participant Abductions" and "Analysis: NASA UFOs on Videos."

The few mental-health professionals who take the subject seriously
have found themselves overwhelmed by patients like Ambrose, ordinary
people who claim no initial interest or belief in UFOs but who
suddenly seem beset by symptoms that closely resemble post-traumatic
stress disorder.

Even skeptics acknowledge that a growing number of people around the
globe are convinced that they have had a close encounter of the fourth
kind (abduction).  Indeed, a recent survey by the Roper Organization-
-commissioned by UFO believers--suggests that one in 50 adult
Americans, a total of 3.7 million people has had a series of "unusual
personal experiences" that could point to an abduction.

"That number's in the ballpark," insists John Mack, a Harvard Medical
School psychiatrist currently treating some 60 professed abductees. 
"I was shocked when I saw it.  But the more I get into this, the less
I can account for it with any conventional psychiatric explanation."

Most abductees, say sympathetic psychiatrists like Mack, show no sighs
of mental illness.  What typically brings them to a therapist is an
anxiety they're desperate to identify and overcome.  Usually with the
aid of hypnosis, they're led back through a missing-time experience
or what they had thought was a dream to discover memories of a
scenario in which they're taken aboard an alien craft and poked and
prodded by inscrutable, bug-eyed creatures.

That is how Sky Ambrose's tale emerged--under hypnosis by John
Carpenter, a psychiatric social worker in Springfield, Mo.  "After my
first hypnotic regression," she says, "I could still say to myself
that I was crazy.  But after my friend had her session and came up
with the same story, separate from me, with so many matching details,
I couldn't dismiss it as a hallucination."

Under hypnosis, Ambrose says, she learned that the beams from the ball
of light contained two beings, perhaps 5 1/2 feet tall, thin, white,
and virtually featureless except for two huge, dark eyes.  They
floated the women to an enormous craft in the sky, then took them to
a small, circular room in which Ambrose's friend underwent surgery. 
What resembled a small computer chip with tiny hooks or feelers was
implanted deep within her nose.  Alarmed at first, Ambrose found
herself being calmed, she says, by two aliens who rubbed and stroked
her head, and a third with glittering eyes that held her entranced. 
Both women then were taken before the tallest of beings, who
telepathically assured them that the aliens meant no harm.

"He communicated that they're the guardians of Earth and have been for
millions of years," says Ambrose.  "They're working with people who
have chosen to do this work with them."  Then, the women say, they
were returned to their car, with no memory of their abduction.  The
friend says she later suffered nosebleeds as a result of the implant
but has never had a medical examination to detect it.
