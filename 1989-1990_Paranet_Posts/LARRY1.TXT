 The Continuing Debate Over UFO's
 04/10/92
 Larry King Live
 David Jacobs, a history professor, has written a book suggesting
 that  more than one million Americans have been abducted and taken
 aboard   UFO's for study. He is debated by UFO researcher, Phillip
 Klass.
 
 KING:  Welcome back to Larry King Live.  For decades we've taken
 our UFO stories with a wink and a giggle - signals that this is
 crazy territory, too weird to study with a straight face.  David
 Jacobs is out to change all that.  He is a respected history
 professor at Temple University, and he suggests - soberly - that in
 recent years more than a million Americans have been taken aboard
 UFO's - not just seen them, seen inside them.  Jacobs has produced
 what many call the first scholarly study of the abduction
 phenomenon, pouring over 300 terrifying stories for his new book
 Secret Life:  Firsthand Accounts of UFO Abductions, just out from
 Simon and Schuster.  And David Jacobs joins us in Washington.
 Why do you believe all this?
 DAVID JACOBS, Author, `Secret Life':  Well, even though it
 sounds incredible, as a historian you have to go where the evidence
 leads you, even though you may not like going there.  And in my
 opinion, the evidence suggests that this is something that should
 be taken seriously.
 KING:  A common occurrence?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Extremely common occurrence, far more common than
 even I would like to see.
 KING:  What is the general scenario?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Well, the general scenario is that a person is
 taken from the normal environment.  They are taken onboard an
 object - a UFO.  Their clothes are removed.  They're placed on a
 table.  There's a series of physical, mental, and reproductive
 procedures that are performed upon them and then they are put back
 in their normal place and made to forget about what happened within
 minutes or even seconds after it's happened.
 KING:  This has been going on, David, for how long?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Well, we're limited by the age of the people who
 come to see us to see how far back it goes, but we think it goes
 back to the 20's and perhaps to the turn of the century, although
 perhaps on a much smaller scale.
 KING:  You're a serious professor of history.
 Mr. JACOBS:  Yes.
 KING:  You've conducted interviews with all of these people?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Yes.
 KING:  Is any one of them well known?
 Mr. JACOBS:  There are some well-known people that I and other
 colleagues have worked with, but they have requested anonymity and-
 KING:  Why?
 Mr. JACOBS:  -and I won't betray that.
 KING:  Do you know why?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Yes, because-
 KING:  Because I'm going to tell you the truth.  If it happened
 to me tonight, I'd call you tomorrow, David.
 Mr. JACOBS:  Well- {Laughs
 
 KING:  I would.
 Mr. JACOBS:  Some people would do that.  Those people have not
 come forward yet but, of course, the subject is so absolutely crazy
 in a way that you can't make these kinds of assertions - you can't
 say, `This might have happened to me,' and expect to be treated in
 the same way ever again, basically.
 KING:  Is Whitley Strieber a good example?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Well, Whitley Strieber is a person who did come
 forward with his experiences and he is a writer, of course, and was
 successful in talking about them.  His examples sometimes fit what
 we know and sometimes they don't fit what we know.
 KING:  What are they studying, David?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Well, we don't actually see a study.
 KING:  They're undressing people and looking at their bodies?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Right.
 KING:  What- What-
 Mr. JACOBS:  I wish it was a study.  I wish we did see a study.
 But we see a sort of a program that is based on, in a sense, a
 physiological exploitation - an agenda, in a sense, that has us as-
 has people as victims, in a way, or, as the abductees say, as
 simply lab rats or specimens.
 KING:  Guinea pigs.  Experiments?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Yes.
 KING:  What kind of experiments?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Well, it's not really experiments.  Once again,
 it's more of a program that involves taking sperm and eggs and-
 KING:  They get involved sexually?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Well, no, not necessarily sexually - more
 reproductively.  We see quite a lot of gynecological and urological
 procedures performed.  But we do see people who claim that every
 once in a while an egg is not being collected.  They'll say this
 time there might be something being implanted in them.
 KING:  Do they speak - the aliens?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Well, all of the conversation is telepathic, which
 is an oddity because if this were simply made up, if this were just
 invented, a large percentage of those would most likely be just
 regular verbal communication.  But virtually all of the abductees
 say that it is telepathic.
 KING:  Now are you saying that you might talk to `John Jones' in
 Philadelphia, `Wilma Smith' in Des Moines, and `Sarah Smidlock' in
 San Diego, and they'll all give you similar stories, despite not
 knowing each other?
 Mr. JACOBS:  That's correct.  It's sort of all over the place.
 It's white and black.  It's Jewish and gentile.  It's across ethnic
 groups.  It doesn't matter, the educational level or the economic
 level or the geography.
 KING:  But it's not leaders of industry, leaders of government,
 famous people, celebrated people, major accomplished people?  Why
 not?
 Mr. JACOBS:  It is everybody.
 KING:  All those?
 Mr. JACOBS:  It is all those.
 KING:  All of the above?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Yes, it is-
 KING:  And none of them will come- not one of these famous
 people?
 Mr. JACOBS:  So far, not one has come forward.  In fact, I've
 had trouble just getting some of my abductees in the Delaware
 County area coming forward.  I've only been able to get a few.
 KING:  Do you name them in the book?
 Mr. JACOBS:  I used pseudonyms for everyone in the book.
 KING:  Why wouldn't you give us a chance to go interview them?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Well, in any kind of a medically-based or
 psychologically-based study, pseudonyms are always used.  And they
 sign a release.  They come to me and they want anonymity and I
 guarantee it as long as I can use their story.
 KING:  So what we have to trust - and they are impressive - are
 your credentials.
 Mr. JACOBS:  Right, but you don't have to trust me or my
 credentials.  I certainly welcome anybody in the scientific
 community to learn how to do this work and see if they can
 reproduce my data.
 KING:  How are you treated by fellow faculty members at Temple?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Well, Temple University is a liberal institution.
 They believe in academic freedom; allow me to do the kind of
 research that I want to do.
 KING:  I know that, but how liberal, David?  Do they say,
 {Whistles
 `Here comes David'?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Yes, some do.  They do do that.  Most of them are
 fairly neutral.  A few are inquiring.  Most of them feel that this
 is just something that they would leave to me, this is a- I've got
 some strange streak in me or something like that, and they're
 interested, but not that interested.
 KING:  Are these definitely from some other planet?
 Mr. JACOBS:  They seem to be from- They're not from Earth, from
 what we can tell.  I can't exactly tell you they're from another
 planet - which is odd - because we really don't know anything at
 all about them.
 KING:  None of these people were taken on trips?
 Mr. JACOBS:  No, not that we know of.
 KING:  What do they look like?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Well, all the reports are basically the same, once
 again.  They're small; they're gray; they have huge black eyes - no
 whites; no hair, no ears, no nose; only a slit for a mouth; a very
 thin, narrow neck; thin frail bodies; thin arms and legs.
 KING:  Vice presidents of networks - little joke there.  OK -
 little joke - little humor - it's Friday.
 We're going to pause and come back.  Phillip Klass will join
 us.  He's contributing editor to Aviation Week and Space
 Technology, and he says, `No way' - Don't go 'way.
 
 {Commercial break
 
 
 KING:  The suggestion that aliens - forgive me for laughing, but
 it's kind of amusing to think about it - are borrowing Americans by
 the carload for medical probes is, naturally, hard to swallow, no
 matter how much serious study lies behind it.  One skeptic is
 Phillip Klass, a contributing editor to Aviation Week and Space
 Technology.  He has written his own critical analysis of abduction
 reports.  Phillip Klass joins our discussion with David Jacobs,
 author of Secret Life:  Firsthand Accounts of UFO Abductions.
 Phillip, have you read David's book?
 PHILLIP KLASS, UFO Skeptic:  No, I've not, but I've read many of
 his papers.  I heard him speak in Chicago.  I attend most of the
 UFO conferences.
 KING:  And?
 Mr. KLASS:  And you smile and you laugh but, in my opinion, this
 is very serious business.  It's serious business because, if his
 fantasies are fact, it is the greatest threat to the wellbeing of
 the people of this nation - of this planet - since this country was
 created.
 KING:  Why?
