Subject Harold Wheaton Revisited Part 4.

Now I will put down some of my comments about the posting of Howard
Wheaton that appeared in the Net a time and a half time ago. Hr asked me
to put down what I considered to be the truth in relation to his statements.
So here we go;

..................................................................................
First we'll start with Mr. Wheaton's thoughts.

The  Greys:  these are the entities who wish to perform experiments without
giving  much  care  to  the  victims.   JW (They are very much like our own
scientist who at the present time have a living spaceman who they freeze at
all  times  except  when  they wake him up and ask him some questions about
their  means of propulsion.  He hasn't talked yet and he is frozen the last
reports I got.)

        Small  greys:   these  entities  are  around  4  feet tall and have
	limited facial features except for large wraparound eyes.  They are
	the ones most described in abduction reports.

        Tall  greys:  these entities are very tall (7-8 feet?) and are also
	involved  in  abductions.   They  tend to be much more caring about
	humans  and also appear to have very advanced telepathy (even tele-
	kinesis!) abilities.  We may consider them benevolent if abductions
        were  not  in  their  agenda.   JW  (Some of the time they are half
	breeds from the union of captured Plieadeans and the Greys.)

        Insect  greys:   these  entities  account  for about a tenth of the
	abduction  reports.   They  are  described  as  praying-mantis type
	creatures.   Abduction victims come away as extremely terrified and
	these  greys  are  probably  the  least  concerned about human well
	being.  JW (Most Greys are very insect like in that they don't have
	blood like us but sort of a colored fluid and it's not red.)

        Abductions:   Various  people  all  over  the  world,  of different
	economic and social backgrounds, report being taken aboard an alien
	craft.   Various  creatures  (greys)  supposedely  perform  strange
	medical  operations  on  the  victims.   The  greys are most likely
	creating  some kind of mixed breed of creatures and human sperm and
	eggs  are needed.  The victim is later returned but he/she does not
	generally feel "good" about the event.  Many victims are taken over
	and over.  (There is much more to this than what I am covering.)
        JW (Not all abduction cases are bad.  I know some of my friends who
        have  been  taken  aboard  craft and they have met space people who
	they  remembered  from  previous lives.  These people are trying to
	awaken  these  people to their purpose of why they came to earth to
  	live in the body they have now.)

        Men In Black #1 (MIB1):  These are highly trained secret government
        agents.   The  MIB1  fly completely black helicopters (no markings)
	and  escort test flights (human piloted) of alien craft.  They also
	are  among  the first to appear at a downed alien craft.  I believe
	they  wear black jumpsuits and may even drive black cars if needed.
	JW  (Yes this type work for our government and look out for our own
	pilots.)


        Men  In  Black  #2 (MIB2):  These are part robotic, part biological
	entities  created by the greys JW (These are especially made by the
	by  the  people  from  Sirius.) to prevent certain information from
	reaching  the public.  (Remember, if too much information gets out,
	the  greys  will  get  in trouble since the Prime Directive will be
	violated.)  JW  (The  Greys  don't  pay  any attention to The Prime
	Directive.)
   
         Part 4.

         John Winston.
