The Mass Abduction Event of December 8, 1992 
by Dale Musser 
 
Note: In the following report, the term "alien(s)" is used generically
to denote the abducting entities, and does not presuppose an  
extraterrestrial origin. 
 
In late summer of 1992, Derrel Sims, chief abductions investigator for
HUFON (Houston UFO Network) implemented a plan  to establish  
communications with alien abductors.  This was to be accomplished by  
means of hypnotic suggestions implanted in the subconscious minds of  
several subjects with multiple abduction histories.  The intent being,
if any of these subjects were abducted again, the hypnotic
suggestions   would allow the individuals to gather data and/or
establish more   positive contact with the aliens.  
 
In November of 1992, subject DS92007PH was abducted.  The subject  
maintained conscious memory for a fair amount of time into the  
abduction before the aliens were able to "zap" the subject (place the 
subject in a mental state where they no longer have conscious
memories   of the event).  At the beginning of the abduction, the
subject was able   to communicate with the aliens, although they did
not appear to be   terribly inclined to communicate or reveal much
information.  As the   aliens were completing their preparations for
their examination, the   subject felt herself losing mental  control. 
The aliens began to reinforce   their efforts to "zap" her.  In one
last effort to maintain consciousness   and communication as long as
possible she blurted out "We know what   your doing... we know
about..." (subject still under investigation).  This   statement
seemed to evoke a reaction on the part of the aliens and   appears to
have predicated the events that follow. 
 
 Starting December 8, 1992, just prior to the HUFON meeting "Alien  
Abductions: Working with Abductees," several of the subjects on the  
panel were reabducted.  These abductions were not realized at the
time, but over the next few days, many of the abductees began
suffering PAS   (Post Abduction Syndrome).  At this time the abductees
were not in   communication with each other.  
 
Subject DS92002DM reported that he had experienced a dream or  
possible flashback of an earlier abduction  When he began having PAS  
and other physical manifestations that accompanied his earlier  
abductions, it became obvious to him that an abduction had taken  
place.   
 
Subjects DM92003JA, DS92034LC & DS92017RP also reported dreams   with
possible abduction signs.  In addition a number of the abductees  
reported having nose bleeds and/or sinus pains.  
 
On Thursday, December 10th, at the monthly HUFON meeting, a   number
of the abductees were questioned by the audience about their  
experiences.  Although most of the abductees were very uncomfortable  
and felt that they "...shouldn't be talking about (their) abductions,"
the meeting went quite well.   
 
On Friday morning, December 11, many of the abductees (most of whom  
were on the panel the night before), awoke to find they had nose
bleeds   during the night.  Almost all had sinus pains and within a
day or two   almost all had head colds and flu like symptoms.  
 
Subject DS92009LT awoke on the 11th with an irritation in one eye.   
While rubbing her eye, a small object (about the size of a mustard
seed)   came out of her eye.  The subject called Derrel Sims and
turned the   object over to him.  
 
This object has been photographed and is currently undergoing  
analysis.  The object appears to be made out of a flesh-colored
plastic.    It is somewhat egg-shaped (with the narrow end open) and
is hollow   inside.  
 
On the same day, subject DS92002DM awoke to discover he had a nose  
bleed (the first in over 20 years). He also called Derrel Sims to make
immediate arrangements for a hypnosis session.  On Sunday, December 
20, 1992, DS92002DM was regressed hypnotically to his latest  
encounter with aliens.   
 
The event occurred the night of December 10, the night of the HUFON  
meeting.  Some time after the subject went to sleep for the night, he
was   awakened by aliens in his bedroom who, in a very quick
procedure,   removed a nasal implant from the subject and immediately
left (later   under hypnosis a number of other abductees reported
similar events).    Mr. Sims then regressed the subject to the next
earliest abduction   (December 8).  
 
On December 8, subject DS92002DM awoke and observed a bright flash  
of light (there was no sound of thunder following). The subject rolled
over and noticed a small gray alien "wearing a harness/utility
belt."  The   subject was instructed to follow the alien outside,
where a blue/white   light was shining on a spot on the ground.  The
subject was instructed   to stand in the light, and an instant later,
found himself in a large   circular room  (about the size of a high
school gymnasium).   
 
The subject was instructed to disrobe and led out of the room and  
through a series of corridors and passageways. Part of the time they  
walked but mostly they were transported by a means unknown by the  
subject (floated or on a conveyor).   
 
Eventually, they arrived at a small room where several other aliens
were   present. A quick physical examination was given and then a
human-  appearing individual entered the room (the subject in prior
abductions   had never encountered a human). The human asked several
questions   as to how/why the abductee knew he had been abducted
before.  The   subject was also asked how abductees knew/found out
about other   abductees and why were they meeting together.   
 
A model of the human brain was shown to the subject and he was asked  
to indicate where the "subconscious mind was located." When the  
subject was unable to indicate a location, he received a mental image
of   another abductee (DS92007PH) in a state of suspended animation
and   had the impression she was being asked the same questions.  The 
 human then left the room and the subject was moved to another room.  
 
This room appeared to be some type of meeting or conference room.  It 
also was round, but the lighting and the furnishings were quite  
different.  A number of different alien life forms entered the room,
the   last being the  one with human appearance.  The small grey
aliens left   the room but two of the taller brown aliens stayed. 
(The description of   the other life forms is being withheld pending
further investigation).   
 
The subject was again questioned as to the nature of the subconscious 
mind and to his knowledge of his abductions and other abductees.    
After each question the subject received images of other abductees. 
He   could see them in a room together.  They were all nude and seemed
to   be unaware of the presence of each other. Each seemed to be in a
halucinative state and behaved as if acting out a part.
