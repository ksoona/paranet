Gleason (part 2) by Timothy Green Beckley



    "Jackie Gleason was interested in hearing my story first
hand," Warren offers as a means of  explaining  how  he  met 
the famous comic in May, 1986.  "At the time  I  was  living  in
 Con- necticut and both CNN  and  HBO  had  run  pieces  on  the
 Bent- waters  case.  Through  mutual  friends   who   knew  
members   of his family, I was told that Gleason would like to 
talk  with  me privately in his home in Westchester County,  and
 so  the  meet- ing was  set  for  a  Saturday  when  we  would 
both  have  some time to relax'  "    After being formally
introduced, the  two  men  ventured  into Gleason's recreation
room complete with  pool  table  and  full- size bar.  ,There 
were  hundreds  of  UFO  books  all  over  the place," Warren
explains, "but Jackie was quick to  tell  me  that this was only
a tiny portion of his entire collection, which  was housed in
his home in Florida.'    For the rest of  the  day,  UFO 
researcher  and  UFO  witness exchanged information.  "Gleason 
seemed  to  be  very  well  in- formed on the subject," Larry
says,  "as  he  knew  the  smallest detail about  most  cases 
and  showed  me  copies  of  the  book Clear intent that had
just been published, as well as a  copy  of Sky  Crash,  a 
British  book  about  Bentwaters  that  was  pub- lished,
actually, before all the details of this case  were  made
public.  I remember  Gleason  telling  me  about  his  own 
sight- ings of several discs in Florida and how he  thought 
there  were undersea UFOs bases out in the Bermuda Triangle."   
But it wasn't till after Warren had downed  a  few  beers  and
Gleason  had  had  a   number   of   drinks-"his   favorite  
Rob Roys"-that  conversation  really  got  down  to  brass  
tacks.    "At some point, Gleason turned to me  and  said,  "I 
want  to tell you something very  amazing  that  will  probably 
come  out some  day  anyway.  We've  got  em!'  'Got  what,  I 
wanted   to know?' 'Aliens!' Gleason sputtered, catching his
breath."    According to Warren, Jackie  proceeded  to  tell 
him  the   intriguing set of circumstances  that  led  him  to 
the  stunning  con- clusion  that  extraterrestrials  have 
arrived  on  our   cosmic shores.    "It was back when Nixon was
in  office  that  something  truly amazing  happened   to   me,"
  Gleason   explained.   "We   were close golfing buddies and
had been out on  the  golf  course  all day  when  somewhere 
around  the  15th  hole,  the  subject   of UFOs  came  up.  Not
 many  people  know  this,"   Gleason   told Warren, "but the
President shares  my  interest  in  this  matter and has a large
collection of books in  his  home  on  UFOs  just like I do. 
For some reason, however,  he  never  really  took  me into  his
 confidence  about  what  he  personally  knew  to   be true...
one of  the  reasons  being  that  he  was  usually  sur-
rounded by so many aids and advisers."    Later that night, 
matters  changed  radically,  when  Richard Nixon  showed  up 
at  Gleason's  house  around   midnight.   "He was all  alone 
for  a  change.  There  were  no  secret  service agents with
him or anyone else.  I  said,  'Mr.  President,  what are you
doing here?' and he said  he  wanted  to  take  me  some- place
and show me something."    Gleason got into the President's
private  car  and  they  sped off into  the  darkness-their 
destination  being  Homestead  Air Force Base.    "I remember we
got to the gate  and  this  young  MP  came  up to the car to
look to see inside and his jaw  seemed  to  drop  a

  foot when he  saw  who  was  behind  the  wheel.  He  just 
sort  o  pointed and we headed off."    Warren says that later
Gleason found out  that  the  secret  ser-  vice  was  going 
absolutely  crazy  trying  to  find   out   where  Nixon was.   
"We drove to the very  far  end  of  the  base  in  a 
segregated  area,"     Gleason went  on,  "finally  stopping 
near  a  well  guarded  building.  The security police  saw  us 
coming  and  just  sort  of  moved back as we passed them and
entered the structure.    "There were  a  number  of  labs  we 
passed  through  first  be-  fore  we  entered  a  section 
where  Nixon  pointed  out  what  he  said was the wreckage 
from  a  flying  saucer,  enclosed  in  sev-  eral large cases."
Gleason noted  his  initial  reaction  was  that  this was all a
 joke brought on  by  their  earlier  conversation  on  the golf
course.    But it wasn't! as Gleason soon learned.    "Next, we
went into an  inner  chamber  and  there  were  six  or  eight
of  what  looked  like  glass-topped  Coke  freezers.  Inside 
them were the mangled remains  of  what  I  took  to  be 
children.  Then-upon   closer   examination-I   saw   that  
some    of    the  other  figures  looked  quite  old.  Most  of
 them  were  terribly  mangled as if they had been in an
accident."    According   to   Larry   Warren's   testimony  
(regarding    his  lengthy  conversati  UFOs and space 
visitors.  He  said  he  even  drank  more  heavily  than usual 
until  he  could  regain  some  of  his  composure  and  come
back down to everyday reality."    Larry  Warren  is  convinced 
that  Gleason   wasn't   lying   to  him.    "You could tell
that  he  was  very  sincere-he  took  the  whole  affair very
seriously, and I could tell that he wanted to  get  the  matter
off his chest, and this was why he was  telling  me  all  of 
this."    And as far  as  Larry  Warren  was  concerned,  the 
Great  One's  personal  testimony  only  added  extra 
credibility  to  his   own  first hand experience with aliens
while  he  was  in  the  service.

   "Jackie felt just like  I  do  that  the  government  needs 
t 'come clean,' and tell us all it knows about space  visitors. 
It time they stopped lying to the public and  release  all  the 
evi dence they have.  When they do, then  we'll  all  be  able 
to  see the same things the late Jackie Gleason did!"  
Hopeorget whether he said they had three  or  four  fin-  gers 
on  each  hand,  but  they  definitely  were  not  human...of 
this he was most certain!"    For  three  weeks  following  his 
trip  with  Nixon   to   Home-  stead  Air  Force  Base,  the 
world  famous  entertainer  couldn't  sleep and couldn't eat. 
"Jackie told me  that  he  was  very  trau-  matized by  all  of
 this.  He  just  couldn't  understand  why  our  government 
wouldn't  tell  the  public   all   they   knew   about  UFOs
and space  visitors.  He  said  he  even  drank  more  heavily 
than usual  until  he  could  regain  some  of  his  composure 
and  come back down to everyday reality."    Larry  Warren  is 
convinced  that  Gleason   wasn't   lying   to  him.    "You
could tell that  he  was  very  sincere-he  took  the  whole 
affair very seriously, and I could tell that he wanted to  get 
the  matter off his chest, and this was why he was  telling  me 
all  of  this."    And as far  as  Larry  Warren  was 
concerned,  the  Great  One's  personal  testimony  only  added 
extra  credibility  to  his   own  first hand experience with
aliens while  he  was  in  the  service.

   "Jackie felt just like  I  do  that  the  government  needs

It time they stopped lying to the public and  release  all  the

to  see the same things the late Jackie Gleason did!"  
Hopefully this day may arrive soon.
