                   MEMORIES OF A DISTANT STAR?

 THE DOGON PEOPLE OF WEST AFRICA HAVE A DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF
THE UNIVERSE THAT IS ASTONISHINGLY ACCURATE. WAS IT, AS THEY
CLAIM, PASSED ON BY ANCIENT ASTRONAUTS?

   Like many African tribes, the Dogon people of the Republic
of Mali have a shadowed past. They settled on the Bandiagara
Plateau, where they now live, some time between the 13th and
16th centuries. For most of the year, their homeland - 300
miles (500 km) south of Timbuktu - is a desolate, arid, rocky
terrain of cliffs and gorges, dotted with small villages built
from mud and straw.
   Although most anthropologists would class them as
'primitive', the two million people who make up the Dogon and
surrounding tribes would not agree with this epithet. Nor do
they deserve it, except in the sense that their way of life has
changed little over the centuries. Indifferent though they are
to Western technology, their philosophy and religion is both
rich and complex. Outsiders who have lived with them, and
learned to accept the simplicity of their lives, speak of them
as a happy, fulfilled people whose attitude to the essential
values of life dates back millennia.

VISITORS FROM SIRIUS

   The Dogon do, however, make one astounding claim; that they
were originally taught and 'civilised' by creatures from outer
space - specifically, from the star system Sirius, 8.7 light
years away. And they back up this claim with what seems to be
extraordinarily detailed knowledge of astronomy for such a
'primitive' and isolated tribe. Notably, they know that Sirius,
the brightest star in the sky, has a companion star, invisible
to the naked eye, which is small, dense, and extremely heavy.
This is perfectly accurate. But its existence was not even
suspected by Western astronomers until the middle of the 19th
century; and it was not described in detail until the 1920s,
nor photographed (so dim is this star, known as Sirius B) until
1970.
   This curious astronomical fact forms the central tenet of
Dogon mythology. It is enshrined in their most secret rituals.
portrayed in sand drawings, built into their sacred
architecture, and can be seen in carvings and patterns woven
into their blankets - designs almost certainly dating back
hundreds, if not thousands of years.

 INTERPLANETARY CONNECTION

  All in all, this has been held as the most persuasive
evidence yet that Earth had, in its fairly recent past, an
interplanetary connection - a close encounter of the
educational kind, one might say. The extent of Dogon knowledge
has also been subjected to scrutiny, in order to establish
whether all that they say is true, or whether their information
may have come from an Earthbound source - a passing missionary,
say.
   So, how did we in the West come to know of the Dogon
beliefs? There is just one basic source, fortunately very
thorough. In 1931, two of France's most respected
anthropologists, Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen decided
to make the Dogon the subject of extended study. For the next
21 years, they lived almost constantly with the tribe; and , in
1946, Griaule was invited by the Dogon priests to share their
innermost sacred secrets. He attended their rituals and their
ceremonies, and learned - so far as it was possible for any
Westerner to do - the enormously complex symbolism that stems
from their central belief in amphibious creatures, which they
called Nommo, and that came from outer space to civilise the
world. (Griaule himself came to be revered by the Dogon as much
as their priests, to such an extent that at his funeral in Mali
in 1956, a quarter of a million tribesmen gathered to pay him
homage.)
   The findings of the two anthropologists were first published
in 1950, in a cautious and scholarly paper entitled 'A
Sudanese Sirius System' in the Journal de la Societe des
Africainistes. After Griaule's death, Germaine Dieterlen
remained in Paris, where she was appointed Secretary General of
the Societe des Africainistes at the Musee de l'Homme. She
wrote up their joint studies in a massive volume intitled Le
Renard Pele, the first of a planned series, published in 1965,
by the French National Institute of Ethnology.

 ELIPTICAL ORBIT

   The two works make it overwhelmingly clear that the Dogon
belief system is indeed based on a surprisingly accurate
knowledge of astronomy, mingled with a form of astrology. Lying
at the heart of it is Sirius, and the various stars and planets
that they believe orbit around this star. They also say that
its main companion star, which they call 'po tolo', is made of
matter heavier than anything on Earth, and moves in a 50-year
elliptical orbit.
   All these things are true. But Western astronomers only
deduced that something curious was happening around Sirius
about 150 years ago. They had noted certain irregularities in
its motion, and they could explain this only by postulating the
existence of another star close to it, which was disturbing
Sirius' movements through the force of gravity. In 1862, the
American astronomer Alvan Graham Clark actually spotted the
star when testing a new telescope, and called it Sirius B.
   However, it was to take another half-century from the first
observation of Sirius' peculiarities for a mathematical and
physical explanation to be found for such a small object
exerting such massive force. Sir Arthur Eddington, in the 1920s
formulated the theory of certain stars being 'white dwarfs' -
stars near the end of their life that have collapsed in on
themselves and become superdense.

 A BAFFLING PROBLEM

   The description fitted the Dogon version precisely. But how
could they have learned about it in the three years between
Eddington's announcement of the theory in a popular book in
1928, and the arrival of Griaule and Dieterlen in 1931? The two
anthropologists were baffled. 'The problem of knowing how, with
no instruments at their disposal, men could know of the
movements and certain characteristics of virtually invisible
stars has not been settled', they wrote.
   At this point, another researcher entered the scene - Robert
Temple, and American scholar of Sanskrit and Oriental Studies
living Europe - who became deeply fascinated by two questions
raised.
  Firstly, was the evidence of the Dogon understanding of
astronomy to be believed? And secondly, if the answer to the
first question was positive, how could they conceivably have
come by this knowledge?

 ANCIENT WISDOM

   A careful reading of the source material, and discussions
with Germaine Dieterlen in Paris, convinced him after a time
that the Dogon were indeed the possessors of an ancient wisdom
that concerned not just Sirius B, but the solar system in
general. They said the Moon was 'dry and dead like dry dead
blood'. Their drawing of the planet Saturn had a ring around it.
(Two other exceptional cases of primitive tribes privy to this
information are known.) They knew that planets revolved round
the sun, and recorded the movements of Venus in their sacred
architecture. They knew of the four 'major moons' of Jupiter,
first seen by Galileo. (There are now known to be at least 14.)
They knew correctly that the Earth spins on its axis. And they
believed there was an infinite number of stars, and that there
was a spiral force involved in the Milky Way, to which Earth
was connected.
   Much of this came down in Dogon myth and symbolism. Objects
on Earth were said to represent what went on in the skies, but
the concept of 'twinning' made many of the calculations
obscure, so that it could not be said that the evidence was
totally unambiguous. But with Sirius B, in particular, the
central facts seemed unarguable. Indeed, the Dogon deliberately
chose the smallest yet most significant object they could find
- a grain of their essential food crop - to symbolise Sirius B.
(Po tolo means, literally, a star made of fonio seed.) They
also stretched their imaginations to describe how massively
heavy its mineral content was: 'All earthly beings combined
cannot lift it.'
   Temple found their sand drawings particularly compelling. The
egg-shaped ellipse might perhaps be explained away as
representing the 'egg of life', or some such symbolic meaning.
But the Dogon were insistent that it meant an orbit - a fact
discovered by the great astronomer Johannes Kepler in the 16th
century, and certainly not known to untutored African tribes.
They also put the position of Sirius exactly where it ought to
be, rather than where someone might naturally guess - that is,
at a focal point near the edge of the ellipse, rather than in
the centre.

 THE NOMMO

   So how did the Dogon come to have this unearthly knowledge?
So far as the Dogon priests are concerned, there is no
ambiguity what soever in the answer to this question. They
believe profoundly that amphiboius creatures from a planet
within the Sirius system landed on Earth in distant times and
passed on the information to initiates, who in turn handed it
down over the centuries. They call ithe creatures Nommo, and
worship them as 'the monitors of the universe, the fathers of
mankind, guardians of its spiritual principles, dispensers of
rain and masters of the water'.

   Temple found that the Dogon also drew sand diagrams to
portray the spinning, whirling descent of a Nommo 'ark', which
he took to mean some sort of spaceship. As he put it: 'The
descriptions of the landing of the ark are extremely precise.
The ark is said to have landed on the Earth to the north-east
of the Dogon country, which is where the Dogon claim to have
come from originally.
   'The Dogon describe the sound of the landing of the ark. They
say the 'word' of Nommo was cast down by him in the four
directions as he descended, and it sounded like the echoing of
the four large stone blocks being struck with stones by the
children, according to special ryhthms, in a very small cave
near Lake Debo. Presumably a thunderous vibrating sound is what
the Dogon are trying to convey. One can imagine standing in
the cave and holding one's ears at the noise. the descent of
the ark must have sounded like a jet runway at close range.'
   Other descriptions that the Dogon priests used to refer to
the landing of the 'ark' tell how it came down on dry land and
'displaced a pile of dust raised by the whirlwind it caused.
The violence of the impact roughened the ground... it skidded'.

 CONCLUSIVE PROOF

    Robert Temple's conclusions, first published in 1976 in his
book The Sirius Mystery, are at once highly provocative and
extensively researched. As such, his findings have been used as
ammunition both by those who believe in extra-terrestrial
visitations in Earth's formative past, and by those (including
the majority of scientists and historians) who believe the idea
is bunkum.
   Erich von Daniken, for instance, whose best-selling books on
the subject have now been shown to be based, in the main, on
distorted evidence, has welcomed the Dogon beliefs, calling
them 'conclusive proof...of ancient astronauts'. Against him
range a number of science writers - among them Carl Sagan and
Ian Ridpath - who believe the case is by no means proved, and
that Temple has read too much into Dogon mythology.
   Robert Temple himself, years ofter first becoming interested
in the subject, found nothing to retract from in the answer he
gave to his publisher, who expressed his central doubt about
the manuscript thus: 'Mr Temple, do you believe it? Do you
believe it yourself?'
   Temple answered: 'Yes, I do. I have become convinced by my
own research. In the beginning I was just investigating. I was
sceptical. I was looking for hoaxes, thinking it couldn't be
true. But then I began to discover more and more pieces which
fit. And the answer is: Yes, I believe it.'
   The crucial question is whether the Dogon's knowledge could
have been obtained in any more ordinary, mundane way.

    ****End****

                   IS ANYBODY OUT THERE?

 EVEN IF SOMEONE IS INDEED LISTENING, WILL OUR MESSAGES
NECESSARILY BE UNDERSTOOD?

   Mankind's first radio message to the stars was transmitted
at 5 p.m. on 16 November 1974 by the world's largest radio
telescope, a disc 1,000 feet (300 metres) in diameter, situated
in Puerto Rico. The message was a three-minute signal sent out
across the vastness of space towards a group of stars 24,000
light years away. It is believed to be the strongest signal yet
radiated by mankind; and in the words of the Aracibo staff, it
was intended to be 'a concrete demonstration that terrestrial
radio astronomy had now reached a level of advance entirely
adequate for interstellar radio communication over immense
distances'.
   The Aracibo transmission was a statement of faith by the
scientific community. It bore witness to the confidence of
scientists that intelligent extraterrestrial beings exist and
are 'out there' listening. In fact, many people would argue
that it would be very surprising indeed if Man were alone in
the galaxy in which he lives, and more surprising still if
there were no other beings to share the huge Universe. It has
even been suggested that there are millions of Earth-like
planets among the billions of planets in the galaxy, and that
the conditions essential to the emergence of life must have
been present on such planets on innumerable occasions. If that
is the case, it is likely not only that extra- terrestrial
intelligence (ETI) exists, but also that in many cases the
technology of civilisations of other planets must have
developed to a stage as advanced as, or even much more advanced
than our own.

   The impulse to attempt to make contact with beings on other
planets is clearly very strong in Man. In the mid-19th century
- a hundred years before sophisticated technology made such
ambitions at all realistic - many people took it more or less
for granted that there were civilisations on other planets that
could be reached with the aid of science, and various methods
of communication with these civilisations were proposed.
   The French inventor Charles Cros (1842-88), for example,
suggested the construction of a vast mirror that could be used
to reflect sunlight from Earth to Mars. It could be tilted, he
thought, to flash out a form of code. (The idea was ingenious,
but it raised an insurmountable problem: there was, of course,
no guarantee that a Martian civilisation would recognise or be
able to respond to such a code.)

 SPECTACULAR MESSAGES

   Nevertheless, interest in establishing communication with
extra-terrestrial beings soon grew to fever pitch. In Paris, in
1900, for example, a prize of 1000,000 francs was offered to
the first person who would manage to make contact with ETI. The
competition excluded communication with Mars, however - that
was thought to be far too easy a feat to be worth the money!
   These enthusiastic early experiments proved fruitless,
however. It is doubtful whether the crude techniques that were
suggested could have served the purpose of initiating contact
with extra-terrestrial civilisations, and it has since been
established that there is no ETI on the Moon, on Venus or on
Mars. yet the search for intellegent life on other planets
continues; and, ironically enough, in the 20th century, we have
transmitted spectacular messages to the stars with no special
effort.
   Since the 1940s, powerful microwave beams from radar and TV
transmitters have been leaking out into space. This radio noise
is already washing over the stars nearest to Earth like a tide
of electro-magnetic flotsam; and although its intensity is
minute, a sufficiently sensitive receiver could pick up the
signal as far as 40 light years away.

 MEANINGFUL SIGNALS

   So what would an extra-terrestrial astronomer make of this
swelling tide of radio noise? If he had sustained his
observations over a long period of time, he would have made an
interesting discovery: today, Earth is emitting radiation at
the frequency of radio waves that is a million times more
intense than it was a few decades ago. And if he used his radio
telescope to measure the radio power emerging from this small
planet at metre wavelengths, he would make an even more
astounding discovery: Earth is emitting almost as much
radiation as the Sun at a time of low sunspot activity. In
fact, in the radio spectrum, our planet is as bright as a star!
   Extra-terrestrial scientists would perhaps attempt to
formulate a 'natural' explanation for the phenomenon; but any
such attempt would eventually prove unsatisfactory. They would
be forced to acknowledge that the radio emission could not be
explained by the action of natural forces: it could only be
produced by artificial means. However, scientists on other
planets might not regard such weak signals as incontrovertible
proof of the existence of a civilisation somewhere near our Sun.
Even if they concluded that a civilisation did exist, they would
probably find it impossible to make sense of the complicated
mix of signals.
   One solution to this dilemma is for us to indicate our
presence unambiguously by transmitting a constant and
deliberate message via a powerful radio beam, aimed at the
stars. Existing radio telescopes provide us with the
technological means to do this.
   Meanwhile, if we are trying to contact civilisations that
may exist on other planets, it is conceivable that such
civilisations may be attempting to communicate with Earth -
perhaps some are even transmitting messages right now. Our
radio telescopes would probably be sensitive enough to pick up
their signals, but for two problems; we know neither where
their transmissions might come from, nor the wavelength into
which we should tune.
   Imagine a transistor radio that is unable to pick up a radio
station unless its aerial is pointed directly at the
transmitter. The search for a particular station would involve
not only exhaustive research to identify the direction of the
transmitter, but also tuning through all the wavebands to find
the right channel. Radio astronomers face just this problem,
except that they are obliged to search through a vastly greater
frequency band. There is the added disadvantage, too, that
they may need to listen for several minutes on each wavelength
in order to detect any faint signal against the background
noise.

 TUNING IN

   Radio telescopes can be tuned to receive a specific
wavelength; but if a message were being transmitted on another
wavelength, it would be missed. Clearly, it would be
impracticable to construct radio telescopes tuned to
every possible wavelength in the hope of picking up signals from
other planets. Is there, then, some way in which the task could
be simplified? Might it be possible to determine which
wavelengths might be chosen for the transmission of messages
from other planets?
   During the Second World War, the Dutch astronomer Hendrick
Christoffel van den Hulst calculated that hydrogen atoms might
sometimes change from one energy state to another and, in so
doing, might emit a photon (a quantity of electro-magnetic
radiation energy) with a frequency corresponding to a radio
wavelength of 21 centimetres. Individual hydrogen atoms, he
postulated, would undergo this transition very rarely. However,
because hydrogen is the predominant element in the Universe, he
predicted that the microwave 'notes' emitted by vast quantities
of hydrogen atoms should build up to a level detectable by
super-sensitive equipment. Then, in 1951, the American
physicist Edward Mills Purcell made some observations that
confirmed Van den Hulst's prediction.
   Since hydrogen is the most abundant substance in the
Universe, it is reasonable to assume that any civilisation with
an advanced technology would discover this property of
hydrogen atoms and would conclude, as radio astronomers on
Earth have done, that the 21 centimetre wavelength is one on
which signals could be transmitted and received anywhere in the
Universe, given sophisticated technology.
   The idea of listening for interstellar communications
transmitted on the 21-centimetre wavelength was first suggested
in 1959 by physicists Guiseppe Cocconi and Philip Morrison, and
has been widely adopted by subsequent signal searchers.

 THE WATERHOLE

   Another suggestion along the same lines is to make use of
hydroxyl, the two-atom combination of hydrogen and oxygen that,
next to hydrogen itself, is the most widespread emitter of
microwaves in space. Its microwave emission has a wavelength of
17 centimetres. Since hydrogen and hydroxyl together make
water, the wave band from 17 to 21 centimetres is sometimes
called the 'waterhole'. This region of the radio spectrum
happens to have the least interference from background
radiation and thus makes an ideal, naturally defined search
band for interstellar communication. Its name is particularly
apt, because the hope is that different civilisations will send
and receive messages in this band in the same way as different
species of animals come to drink at waterholes on Earth.
   In 1960, the first serious attempt was made to listen to the
21 centimetre wavelength in the hope of detecting messages from
the stars. This was Frank Drake's Project Ozma. The listening
began at 4 a.m. on 8 April 1960 with no publicity, as the
astronomers feared ridicule. For 150 hours they listened for
signs of an intelligible signal, but they found absolutely
nothing.
   At Green Bank Observatory, in 1976, Benjamin Zuckerman and
Patrick Palmer completed a four-year survey of the 659 stars
most likely to harbour life between six and 76 light years away
from the Sun. Although their equipment was far more sensitive
than that used in Ozma, they too drew a blank.
   Such lack of results may, of course, indicate that we are on
the wrong trail. Up to this point, we have considered only
interstellar radio contact among civilisations at, or just
beyond, our own state of technical advance. yet the bulk of
technical civilisations may be immensely more advanced than
ours. So perhaps we should consider how these technologies
might comminicate with us.
   The Soviet astronomer Kardashev has suggested that
civilisations might exist at three levels. A Level I
civilisation might be regarded as Earth-like, able to exploit
only a portion of the energy resources available to it; a Level
II civilisation might tap the entire energy of its star, thus
harnessing energies 100 trillion times those of Level I
civilisations; and a Level III civilisation might tap entire
galaxies, thus disposing of energies 100 billion times greater
than those of Level II civilistations. If Kardashev's theory is
sound, a Level II civilisation should easily be detectable
throughout its galaxy, and a Level III civilisation throughout
the Universe. Thus we might be tempted to dismiss the
possibility of the existence of such civilisations on the
grounds that we can detect no signs of them anywhere. But are
we listening in the right way? Or are we deaf to a signal that
we are actually receiving loud and clear?

   In 1965, Soviet radio astronomer Scholomitski studied the
radio source CTA 102 and announced that it was varying
significantly in intensity, with an apparent period of 100
days, and transmitting at a wavelength near 18 centimetres that
had previously been proposed for interstellar communication. It
was speculated that the oscillation might serve as a beacon
calling attention to CTA 102, and that on a much shorter
timescale than 100 days the individual words of an interstellar
communication channel might be deciphered. In the Soviet press,
some astronomers openly speculated that CTA 102 bore all the
signs of an artificial source.
   CTA 102 was later identified as a quasar - a natural
source. But even so, might it not be under the control of a
Level II or a Level III civilisation? And might not the same be
true of Pulsars, stars that also send out regular pulses of
radiation?
   To be sure, variations in intensity seem to be quite
irregular in the case of quasars, and quite regular in the case
of pulsars. But in neither case do we appear to be receiving
information from an intellegent source. Could the signals
therefore be messages from beings so intelligent that we cannot
understand them because our mental capacity is limited? This
may be the case, but it seems unlikely because any advanced
civilisation would no doubt appreciate the problems of
interstellar discourse and would surely use the simplest
possible method for establishing contact.
   A more serious problem might be raised, however, by contact
with less advanced civilisations than our own. How would we
comminicate with beings as dull-witted, say, as cows, or as
primitive as Stone Age man - even supposing that we were to
discover such communities? And even if we could devise some
means of communication, we might wish to preserve their culture
and way of life by leaving them undisturbed. (Of course,
super-advanced extra-terrestrial civilisations may regard human
beings as fumbling incompetents and take exactly this
'conservationist' attitude towards us.)

 PROJECT CYCLOPS

   But whether our neighbours in the Universe are super-brains
or savages, much bigger projects will have to be set up if the
search for ETI is to be carried on with any hope of success.
The most famous such proposal is the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) Cyclops project, which would
involve 1,000 or more radio telescopes, each the size of a
football, [maybe they left out the word 'field' there. Mark??
M.W.] steered in unison by a computerised electronic system.
Their combined performance would be equivalent to that
of a single disc 6.2 miles (10 kilometres) in diameter,
virtually impossible to construct because it would collapse
under its own weight.
   Such an array of radio telescopes would, however, be able to
detect radiation as weak as Earth's inadvertant leakage of
microwaves even from a distance of 100 light years, while a
message from another civilisation could perhaps be detected at a
distance of at least 1,000 light years.
   Project Cyclops would not be easy or cheap to construct,
though it is perfectly feasible using existing technology. It
has also been estimated that it would cost many billions of
dollars to build and run - a considerable commitment to the
search for ETI.
   Our technology is capable of mounting a very effective
search for extra-terrestrial signals. But is the search
worthwile? The biggest hurdle is, of course, the fact that we
cannot guarantee success.

Mark, would this 'Cyclops' be the precursor to SETI (HRMS), or
is it a totally different proposal? (didn't realise this
article is so old!)
