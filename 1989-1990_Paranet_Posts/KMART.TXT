Subject: Spaceman Works At K-Mart. 
  It seems that we have a space person living in America now
and his only claim to fame is that he is a night shift clerk
at K-mart. How high on the social scale  can you get? Here
is some information about the man and another person from
space who is a space lady. ...Kmart store manager once worked
as a UFO engineer (JW I'll bet that looked good on his
application).  Paul Wellmer, whose true name is Nommos, was
born on the spaceship Monitor 74 Earth-years ago. He was among
thousands of space aliens aboard the starship, which came from
the planet of TaoPao, an Earth-like world situated in the Sirius
B System of Constellation Canis Major. When his spaceship
crashed on this planet on June 18, 1946, the extraterrestrial
starship engineer survived by invading the body of a 2-month-old
earthling and taking his name. He has been living the life of a
normal human ever since, marrying and getting a job as a night
clerk at Kmart in the small town of Fredericktown, Mo.
  Wellmer says on his native planet, his physical appearance is
entirely different. 
  "Our bodies can adapt to living on land or underwater because
we have gills within our lungs, two circulatory systems and two
hearts," he said.
  (JW Well I don't know much about him but I have read a lot about
the next lady  I'm going to mention.)
  Chicago house wife Omnec Onec is dying to meet space alien Paul
Wellmer-because she's an alien herself and she wants another
extraterrestrial to talk to!
  The blonde mother of three-whose native planet is Venus-read
an article about Wellmer in the April 6, issue of the Weekly
World News and admits she was fascinated. She says she's aware
of other space aliens living in this country, but Wellmer-who
lives in Fredericktown, Mo. -is not know to her because he comes
from outside our solar system.
"I would love for him to come see me in Chicago," said Omnec, whose
book UFO From Venus I Came sold out when it hit the bookstores two
years ago.
There are so many solar systems, each with many planets, and I am
not familiar with every one.  I would love to talk to him and learn
about his world."
  Omnec went public about her alien origins in 1990, when she
published her book in an effort to teach earthlings about the
brotherhood of planets. She says she knows of more than 300 other
aliens from Mars, Saturn, Venus and Jupiter who occupy important
positions in American society. Worldwide, she says, there are more
than 1,000.
  Wellmer, who is called Nommos on his planet of ToePao, says he's
also eager for a space alien powwow.
  "I have not read Omnec Omnec's book but it sounds like something
I should know about," he told the NEWS.
"And I would definitely like to meet her. We have much to talk
about, I'm sure."
  When Wellmer gets together with Omnec, it will be his first
meeting on Earth with another space alien. And the extraterrestrial
admits he's been lonely since the spaceship wreck separated him
from others of his kind.
  "A day doesn't go by that I don't wonder where my fellow crew
members are," he says.
  "It's hard being the only one. I'm delighted to know that Omnec
Onec wants to get together."
              Female extraterrestrial came to earth in 1955!
Born 246 Earth years ago. Omnec Onec was raised on the planet Venus
in a town called Teutonia. She lived on an astral plane-with out a
physical body-until she was instructed by her leaders to travel to
earth with a message of peace and brotherhood.   
Omnec says she was trained to live as a human in an ancient monastery
in Tibet. Eventually she was sent to live in Tennessee with an
earthling family, replacing a 7-year-old child who had died in
a bus wreck. She grew up, married and moved to Chicago, where she
raised three children. worked as a bar maid, a clothes designer
and a cashier.
  She revealed her true space alien nature in 1990, when she wrote
and published her best-selling book. Today she travels around the
United States and Europe, spreading a message of peace and
brotherhood, as he was instructed to do by Venusian leaders.
  JW In the past I had read the first article about Omnec  Omnec and
had gone over to Don Showen's house to talk to him about it. It just
so happened that he had a copy of her book and I obtained it from him.
