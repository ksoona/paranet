Between workshops, they could stop in

($10), their psyches explored ($20 for
20 minutes), or buy model flying
saucers ($5 to $300, the latter a

lights to help viewers get their

Inside the workshops, there were
several recurring themes: UFOs are for

Friedman and author Budd Hopkins -

called his embattled outlook.

After Lear's speech, when a reporter

findings, he broke off the interview

Bruce Maccabee, who has been
investigating UFOs for 20 years,
screened photos taken in the Florida
resort of Gulf Breeze, where, within
the past several months, UFO sightings
have been frequent.

Maccabee explained that to be
considered credible, each sighting has
to be vouched for by at least one
other observer independent of the
photographer.  Maccabee said he has
developed a new technique designed to
more credibly capture UFOs on film.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Through stereo photography, in which a
single camera simultaneously takes a
pair of photos from slightly different
angles, Maccabee said he has been able
to calculate that the photographed
UFOs have come to within a few hundred
feet of earth and are themselves

Military officials subsequently said
that what people saw was a weather

However, allegations persist among

Friedman said he was certain that UFOs

As evidence that the media is starting
