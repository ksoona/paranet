     REPOST WITHOUT PERMISSION:


Below  is  a  long  and deeply paranoid paper by Martin Cannon.  (The paper was
first posted without permission to USENET by James P.  Galasyn and was reposted
without  permission  by Don Nellesen.) Among the 201 footnotes are citations of
Holocaust  revisionist  Victor  Marchetti  (9,  31,  104)  and  of anti-fascist
investigative  journalist  Chip  Berlet  (164),  citations  of  the supermarket
tabloid "National Examiner" (144) and of scientific journals.

    DISCLAIMER:  I recommend giving no greater credence to
    Cannon's theory than one does to reports of little gray
    persons cutting didoes with their interstellar hot rods and
    farm animals with their unearthly shivs.  It might be a good
    concept for another boffo Oliver Stone movie, however.

What  caught  my  attention  was  a section alleging ties between UFO cults and
Nazism.  Cannon writes:

     "Some abductees I have spoken to have been directed to
      join certain religious/philosophical sects.  These cults
      often bear close examination.

     "The leaders of these groups tend to be 'ex'-CIA
      operatives, or Special Forces veterans.  They are often
      linked through personal relations, even though they
      espouse widely varying traditions.  I have heard
      unsettling reports that the leaders of some of these
      groups have used hypnosis, drugs, or 'mind machines' on
      their charges.  Members of these cults have reported
      periods of missing time during ceremonies or 'study
      periods.'

     "I strongly urge abduction researchers to examine closely
      any small 'occult' groups an abductee might join.  For
      example, one familiar leader of the UFO fringe -- a man
      well-known for his espousal of the doctrine of 'love and
      light' -- is Virgil Armstrong, a close personal friend of
      General John Singlaub, the notorious Iran-Contra player,
      who recently headed the neo-fascist World Anti- Communist
      League [...]

     "Even more ominous than possible ties between UFO cults
      and the intelligence community are the cults' links with
      the shadowy I AM group, founded by Guy Ballard in the
      1930s[180].  According to researcher David Stupple, 'If
      you look at the contactee groups today, you'll see that
      most of the stable, larger ones are actually neo-I AM
      groups, with some sort of tie to Ballard's organization.'
      [181] This cult, therefore, bears investigation.

     "Guy Ballard's 'Mighty I AM Religious Activity,' grew, in
      large part, out of William Dudley Pelly's Silver Shirts,
      an American NAZI organization[182].  Although Ballard
      himself never openly proclaimed NAZI affiliation, his
      movement was tinged with an extremely right-wing
      political philosophy, and in secret meetings he 'decreed'
      the death of President Franklin Roosevelt[183].  The I AM
      philosophy derived from Theosophy, and in this author's
      estimation bears a more-than-cursory resemblance to the
      Theosophically-based teachings that informed the
      proto-NAZI German occult lodges[184].

     "After the war, Pelley (who had been imprisoned for
      sedition during the hostilities) headed an
      occult-oriented organization called Soulcraft, based in
      Noblesville, Indiana.  Another Soulcraft employee was the
      controversial contactee George Hunt Williamson (real
      name:  Michel d'Obrenovic), who co- authored UFOs
      CONFIDENTIAL with John McCoy, a proponent of the theory
      that a Jewish banking conspiracy was preventing
      disclosure of the solution to the UFO mystery[185].
      Later, Williamson founded the I AM-oriented Brotherhood
      of the Seven Rays in Peru[186].  Another famed contactee,
      George Van Tassel, was associated with Pelley and with
      the notoriously anti-Semitic Reverend Wesley Swift
      (founder of the group which metamorphosed into the Aryan
      nations).[187]

     "The most visible offspring of I AM is Elizabeth Clare
      Prophet's Church Universal and Triumphant, a group
      best-known for its massive arms caches in underground
      bunkers.  CUT was recently exposed in COVERT ACTION
      INFORMATION BULLETIN as a conduit of CIA funds[188], and
      according to researcher John Judge, has ties to
      organizations allied to the World Anti-Communist
      League[189] Prophet is becoming involved in abduction
      research and has sponsored present- ations by Budd
      Hopkins and other prominent investigators.  In his book
      THE ARMSTRONG REPORT:  ETs AND UFOs:  THEY NEED US, WE
      DON'T NEED THEM[sic][190], Virgil Armstrong directs
      troubled abductees toward Prophet's group.  (Perhaps not
      insignificantly, he also suggests that abductees plagued
      by implants alleviate their problem by turning to 'the I
      AM force' within.[191])

     "Another UFO channeller, Frederick Von Mierers, has
      promulgated both a cult with a strong I AM
      orientation[192] and an apparent con-game involving over-
      appraised gemstones.  Mierers is an anti-Semite who
      contends that the Holocaust never happened and that the
      Jews control the world's wealth.

     "UFORUM is a flying saucer organization popular with Los
      Angeles-area abductees; its founder is Penny Harper, a
      member of a radical Scientology breakaway group which
      connects the teachings of L.  Ron Hubbard with
      pronouncements against 'The Illuminati' (a mythical
      secret society) and other BETES NOIR familiar from
      right-wing conspiracy literature.  Harper directs members
      of her group to read THE SPOTLIGHT, an extremist tabloid
      (published by Willis Carto's Liberty Lobby) which denies
      the reality of the Holocaust and posits a 'Zionist'
      scheme to control the world[193].

     "More than one unwary abductee has fallen in with groups
      such as those listed above.  It isn't difficult to
      imagine how some of these questionable groups might mold
      an abductee's recollection of his experience -- and
      perhaps help direct his future actions.

     "Some modern abductees, with otherwise-strong claims,
      claim encounters with blond, 'Nordic' aliens reminiscent
      of the early contactee era.  Surely, the 'Nordic'
      appearance of these aliens sprang from the dubious
      spiritual tradition of Van Tassell, Ballard, Pelley,
      McCoy, etc.  Why, then, are some modern abductees seeing
      these very same other-worldly UEBERMENSCHEN?

     "One abductee of my acquaintance claims to have had
      beneficial experiences with these 'blond' aliens -- who,
      he believes, came originally from the Pleiades.
      Interestingly, in the late 1960s, the psychopathically
      anti-Semitic Rev.  Wesley Swift predicted this odd twist
      in the abduction tale.  In a broadcast 'sermon,' he spoke
      at length about UFOs, claiming that there were 'good'
      aliens and 'bad' aliens.  The good ones, he insisted,
      were tall, blond Aryans -- WHO HAILED FROM THE PLEIADES.
      He made this pronouncement long before the current trends
      in abduction lore.

     "Could some of the abductions be conducted by an extreme
      right-wing element within the national security
      establishment?  Disagreeable as the possibility seems, we
      should note that the 'lunatic right' is represented in
      all other walks of life; certainly hard-rightists have
      taken positions within the military-intelligence complex
      as well."
