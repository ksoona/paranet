% Mars Observer update
        ...

On  July  26,  the  Mars  Observer spacecraft took the first photograph of Mars
since  the  Viking  missions  of  the mid-70s as it approached the planet.  The
spacecraft  used  its  high  resolution  narrow-angle camera to take the photo-
graph.  The photograph is currently being processed and will be available later
this week.

The Mars Observer switched to an automatic contingency mode, a self- protective
default  mode  on  August  1.   This occurred when the spacecraft per- formed a
larger  than expected attitude correction while it was reorienting its position
relative  to  the  stars  and  the  sun.   Full  recovery to normal cruise mode
occurred on August 2.

At  present,  the  flight  team  reports  that  all  spacecraft  subsystems and
instrument  payload  are  performing  well.   Mars Observer will be captured in
orbit  around  Mars  on  August  24  and  begin  its  global mapping mission in
mid-December.
