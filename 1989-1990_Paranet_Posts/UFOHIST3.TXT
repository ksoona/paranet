July 30,  1976..NMCC Joint Staff Memo:  Subject:  Reports of UFOs.   At
approx. 0345, EDT, the ANMCC received several reports of UFOs near Fort
Ritchie.  At 0130, civilians reported an UFO to the NAB.  At 0255,  two
separate  patrols sighted three UFOs;  oblong with a reddish tint.   At
0300,   the Desk Sgt.  (name with held)  sighted an UFO over  the  ammo
storage area at 100-200  yds.  altitude.  At 0345,  an Army Police Sgt.
sighted an UFO in the vicinity of sight R.  ANMCC was requested to have
each individual write a statement on the sightings. One person said the
UFO was the size of a 2.5 ton truck.                              
                                                                      
Sep. 19, 1976..Tehran, Iran: Civilians reported an UFO to the AFB.  The
Iranian  AF scrambled an American F-4  for intercept.  As the F-4   was
vectored   towards   the  brilliant  UFO,    all   communications   and
instrumentation were suddenly lost. As the pilot broke off pursuit, all
aircraft functions returned to normal. A second F-4  that was scrambled
began  closing in on the UFO at greater than Mach 1 and was closing  on
the UFO at 150  nautical mph., but the UFO accelerated and stayed ahead
of the F-4  (confirmed by  Radar).   Multi-colored flashing lights were
visible  on the UFO.  The moment the F-4  pilot tried to lock an  AIM-9
missile at the UFO he lost all weapons panel and communication control.
The UFO launched two smaller UFOs,  one of which began to follow the F-
4. After evasive action by the F-4, the smaller UFO returned and united
with the larger UFO. The other smaller UFO seemed to have landed on the
ground  so  the  pilot  flew down to investigate it.   The  landed  UFO
appeared to be 12  feet in diameter?  As the pilot descended the  light
from  the landed UFO went out and he lost sight of it.  The DIA  termed
this sighting as "an outstanding report.  This case is a classic  which
meets all the criteria necessary for a study of a UFO phenomenon." And,
"an  inordinate  amount of manuverablilty was displayed by  the  UFOs."
(see 10/2/72,9/20/76)                                             
                                                                      
Sep.  20, 1976..DIA MESSAGE: UFO sighted over Tehran, Iran.  "Initiate"
IPSP PT-1440.  The Iranian Air Force scrambled an F-4  to intercept the
UFO. Due to its brilliance the UFO was visible 70 miles away.  When the
F-4  approached within 25  mi. of UFO the F-4  lost ALL instrumentation
and  communications (UHF and intercom).  As the first F-4  banked  away
from the UFO he regained instr. and comm. A second F-4  was dispatched,
2  man,  with  radar.The radar return was of a craft the  size of a 707
Tanker.  As the F-4  closed within 25 NMi.  of UFO,  the UFO launched a
bright white object about one third the apparent size of the moon.  The
pilot attempted to fire an AIM-9  missile at the second UFO but at that
moment he lost all instruments and communication.As he banked away from
the primary object  the secondary object went to the inside of his turn
then returned and rejoined with the primary object.  Afterwards the F-4
regained control of instr. and communications. (see 9/19/76)      
                                                                    
1976...........Project   SIGMA  becomes  an  independent  project  from

Aug.  9, 1980...through Sep. 3, 1980:  AFOSI Complaint Form:at Kirtland
AFB three persons report seeing UFO over a Restricted Test Range. 
                                                                    
On Aug. 9th a Sandia Security Guard drove down the Coyote Canyon access
road to check out an alarmed building and observed a landed UFO next to
an  alarmed  building.  The UFO was a round disk shaped object.  As  he
approached  the object on foot equipped with a shotgun the object  took
off  in a vertical direction at a high rate of speed.  His radio wasn't
working  right at the time so he couldn't reach dispatch.  The building
contained HQ CR 44 material. [Nature of material not known.]

following  C-5A aircraft inclusive.  Photo analysis of Cylinder  Shaped
UFO legitimate.  PhotoE.  showed legitimate disc shaped UFO of 37   ft.
diameter with trilateral insignia on object. USAF still has an interest
in all UFO sightings over installations and test ranges.  Several other
Government  agencies,   lead by NASA,  actively investigate  legitimate
sightings  through COVERT COVER.  One agency that deceives  the  public
whict such covert cover is the UFO reporting center at U.S.  Coast  and
Geodetic Survey, Rockville, MD. 20852. [The results of PROJECT AQUARIUS
is  still  classified TOP SECRET with access limited to  "MJ-12".]  The
Paul  Bennewitz  case still being monitored by NASA.   Still  receiving
assistance from Fugate(?) Miller. (see 2/1/78)

Deputy Base Commander, RAF Woodbridge stating: Two USAF security police
patrolmen  saw a UFO either hovering or on legs outside the back  gate,
Woodbridge. Being early morning,  it illuminated the entire forest with
a  white light.  Description:  Metallic in appearance and triangular in
shape,   pulsing red light on top and banks of blue lights  underneath.
Approx.  2-3 meters across and 2 meters high. It maneuvered through the
trees and disappeared. (see 12/29/80)

Dec.   29,   1980..A low flying UFO was escorted by a large  number  of
helicopters  (23)   including some Chinooks and possibly  Hueys,   near
Dayton,  Texas.  It was probably escorted to the TOP SECRET underground
installation within Fort Hood, Texas.  The SECRET air force base is NOT
listed in the Air Force Officer's Guide or the Air Force Almanac [it is
an Army AFB]. The name of the Secret base is Gray AAF, Texas.     
                                                                    
(12/29/80,  cont'd)  The special group piloting the helicopters  Escort
for  UFO are known as the "BLUEBOYS".  The Texas Department  of  Public
Safety works closely with Gray AAF on UFO cases. (see 6/6/88)

Nov.   3,   1981...Civil Action,  Case No.  80-1562,  goes against  the
plaintiff and for the defendant, the NSA.  The NSA retains the right to
withhold 156  TOP SECRET records containing communications intelligence
(COMINT)   reports  which were produced between 1958  and  1979.   Only
military personnel with a Top Secret Clearance were allowed to view the
documents for the court hearing.  NOT even the Judge was allowed to see
them, even though he ruled against the plaintiff (CAUS). (see 6/24/83) 
                                                                      
Nov.  27, 1982..Palatine, IL.: Police Commander Michael McDonald was on
patrol at 5:00 a.m. when the area around his car was lighted,  as if by
a phosphorousflare.  Looking up he saw a large white UFO with tinges of
red  at  an altitude of 900-1000  ft.  Two other officers,  alerted  by
radio,  also observed the UFO.  The other two cars gave pursuit to  the
UFO at speeds of between 60-65 mph but the UFO outdistanced them. A few
minutes later another UFO was noted by the commander and then the other
two officers.  It was a diffuse "domed disc"  which was seen to emit  a
beam of light towards the ground.  The UFO then disappeared behind  the
tree  line  of a forest preserve.  The police report  includes  a  tape
recording of the radio communications during the sighting.

Case No.  83-1932 (Judge Oliver Gasch) petitioning for a Writ of Habeas
Corpus  EXTRATERRESTRIAL,  in the United States District Court for  the
Dist.  of Columbia,  seeking to obtain the release from custody of "one
or  more  occupants of apparent extraterrestrial origin."  Mr.   Bryant
contends  that  the  Government action in maintaining  secret  custody,
detention,  and prosecution of such extraterrestrials is unlawful and a
violation  of their basic rights and is seeking to restore their  civil
rights. (see 11/3/81)                                             
                                                                      
Nov.  29,1983...Dr.  Robert I Sarbacher,  President and Chairman of the
Board,   Washington  Institute of Technology,  in a letter  to  William
Steinman states persons definitely involved in operations of  recovered
saucers were John von Neuman and Dr. Vannever Bush. Also, Dr. Sarbacher
thought that Robert Oppenheimer was also involved.  Dr.  Sarbacher  had
been  invited  by  President Eisenhower to attend  several  discussions
associated with the reported recoveries, but was unable to attend them.
He  did receive Special Reports on the recoveries at the  Pentagon  but
was instructed NOT to remove them from his office.                
                                                                    
1984...........From  the  Air Traffic Controllers Manual:   Controllers
MUST  report UFOs immediately to AIS (Military),  LATCC.  A   completed
report  MUST  be  sent  to MOD (AFOR).  A  list of  phone  numbers  and
locations is shown in the directory at Appendix H.                
                                                                    
May 16,  1984...Dept. of the Army letter to W. S. Steinman stating that
the  IPU  was  disestablished in the late 1950s and  all  records  were
transferred  to the Air Force.  Therefore the Army isn't aware of  what
their function was even though it was a Secret unit of the Army.  [FOIA
requests to USAF] (see 3/12/87)                                   
                                                                    
Mar. 19, 1985..(LONDON, ENGLAND)  In a letter from Ministry of Defence,
Lord Trefgarne states,  "There is no organization in the MOD  appointed
solely for the purpose of studying UFOs,  and no staff are employed  on
the  subject full time...  the staff in the Department...  examine  the
reports as part of heir normal duties... and we cannot inform observers
of the probable identity of the objects seen."                    
                                                                      
June 28, 1985..USAF ACCESS RESTRICTED NOTICE: Report TR-DE-3A, Oct. 15,
1955, from Air Tech. Intel. Ctr., file no. TS5-2862, has been WITHDRAWN
from the National Archives and is classified a TOP SECRET UFO REPORT.
