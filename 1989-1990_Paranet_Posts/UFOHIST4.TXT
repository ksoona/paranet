Aug. 27, 1985..Darlian, CHINA, the "China Daily" reports: 20,000 people
are  involved in UFO research.  The first recognized photo of a UFO  in
China  was taken in 1945.  In 1981  CSUR UFO research organization  was
established.   More than 600  UFOs have been reported within the past 5
years  in  China.  Studies will be done on UFOs and Human body  science
relationships.                                                    
                                                                      
May 11,  1986...Near Sadona,  AR: Minister Robert H.  Henderson and his
wife, Nann, of Phoenix, AR, were flying at an altitude of 8500 ft. at 4
p.m. when a very bright UFO was seen approaching head-on to them. As he
prepared to take evasive action the UFO passed quickly to the left  and
below  of his plane.  The UFO was seen to be wingless and resembling  a
"modified half-sphere,  with the flat side down."  The closure rate was
estimated at about 1200 mph.                                      
                                                                     
May 19,  1986...Near Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Between 9:00
to 12  midnight the Brazilian Air Defense and the Civil Air System were
swamped with Radar and pilot UFO sightings. As Ospires Silva, President
of  Petrobras  Oil Company were preparing to land,  the  control  tower
informed him of UFO targets on their radar. He and his companion, Alcir
Pereira da Silva,  saw bright red-orange UFOs, not at all like stars or
planes.  They attempted to pursue the UFOs for 30  min.  but gave up as
the UFOs seemed to be jumping from place to place.  At this time  three
F-5E  fighter  jets were scrambled from Santa Cruz AFB.  Capt.   Marcio
Jordao was able to approach within 12  miles of an UFO,  visible to him
as  a  bright light changing from white to green.  Lt.   Kleber  Caldas
Marinho  chased  another UFO which was a very intense light,   changing
from white to green then red again. Both pilots broke off chase as they
were running low on fuel.  Ground Radar picked up 10-13  more UFOs that
surrounded  another plane with Capt.  Armindo Souza Viriato de Marinho,
K.C. Freitas piloting it. Capt.  Freitas tracked the UFOs on his radar,
but  only  de Freitas,  A.S.V.  saw them visually once as they  climbed
vertically past him. Brig. Gen.  Octavio Moreira Lima made these events
public at a press conference and allowed the pilots and radar operators
to be questioned by the media. (see 7/52)                         
                                                                     
Feb.   15,   1987..The San Jose Mercury states that the Pentagon has  a
"Black  Budget"  which has become a "Black Hole"  for  SECRET  Projects
spending!   It is far bigger than the federal budget for  education  or
transportation  or agriculture or the environment.  These Projects  are
classified  above Top Secret,  therefore very few federal investigators
have the security clearances necessary to audit black programs.   
                                                                   
Mar.  12, 1987..U.S.  Army Intelligenc letter:  The IPU (Interplanetary
Phenomenon  Unit)   of  the Scientific and Technical  Branch,   Counter
intelligence  Directorate,   Department of the Army was  disestablished
during the 1950's and never reactivated. All of its records were turned
over  to the USAF (which can't seem to locate them).  This  letter  was
sent to Timothy Good. (see 5/16/84)                               
                                                                    
Sep.   4,  1987...JMP (Justice for Military Personnel)  letter sent  to
President Ronald Reagan. This letter, verified by: Astronaut L.  Gordon
Cooper,  Maj.  Donald E. Keyhoe (USMC, Ret.), MUFON (Sequin, TX),  APRO
(Tucson,  AZ) and Just Cause (Coventry,  CT)  states that:"WE (military
personnel)   have  been ordered by the CIA to shoot at  UFOs,   silence
pilots  who  have seen UFOs,  intimidate,  harass,  jail,   confine  to
institutions,and   destroy  military  carreers  of  witnesses  to   UFO
sightings.   We  VIOLATED  the Freedom of  Information  Act  by  hiding
Government documents." (see 7/52,9/24/47)                         
                                                                      
Nov.  17, 1986..Near Fort Yukon, Alaska: Japan Airlines flight #1628, a
Boeing 747  freighter, was cruising at 35000  ft.  altitude and at 5:11
p.m.  the pilots noticed bright lights 30 degrees to the left and below
them.  The UFOs moved up directly in front of the 747  and,  said Capt.
Kenju Terauchi,  "most unexpectedly, two spaceships stopped in front of
our face, shooting off lights (like numerous exhaust pipes). The inside
cockpit shined brightly and I felt warm in the face." The UFOs appeared
as two rectangular clusters or arrays of light, one above the other. As
the  larger UFOs moved away from the 747  Airlines Flight  1628   there
remained two smaller flat white UFOs. At about 5:30 p.m. Capt. Terauchi
checked  the  pale white light behind their craft visually.  He  saw  a
gigantic  "walnet-shaped"  UFO (Saturn-shaped)  following them.  As  an
evasive  action the Capt.  ordered the 747  to turn away from the giant
UFO  that  was  following  them,  at which  time  the  UFO  "spaceship"
disappeared.                                                      
                                                                      
Dec. 21, 1987..CIA letter to Mr. Richard Hall stating the CIA's reasons
for  denying  certain  FOIA  requests about himself  on  the  basis  of
national defence reasons and must be kept secret.  Mr.  Hall is an  UFO
investigator.                                                     
                                                                      
May 5,  1988....For the third time,  publicly,  President Ronald Reagan
states that the nations of the earth would unite if we were  threatened
by an Alien race from a hostile planet.                           
                                                                      
Jun.6,   1988....Letter  received  from Paul F.   Bennewitz  describing
Project  Beta:   Alien  base located in New Mexico consisting  of  type
"Grey"   Aliens.   NASA CIR film has aided in locating  this  base  and
revealing  US Military involvement with the "Greys".  Aliens helped  US
Military to build a working saucer, Atomic Powered. Two women and a boy
exposed to radiation burns by this saucer. Government is not picking up
the medical bills.  "Grey"  base is currently abandoned.  Another group
called "Orange"  is based on the west slope of Mt.  Archeleta near "the
Diamond".  Goal of Project Beta: to locate,  inventory and propose ways
of destroying Alien bases! (see 12/29/80)
