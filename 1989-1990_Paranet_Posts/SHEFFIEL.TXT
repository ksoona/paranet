The weekend of 14th/15th of August saw
the 1993 International UFO Conference
held at Hallam University, Sheffield.
I should just point out before I start
that I am (after dozens of varied
books on the subject) a firm believer
in the so-called "nuts and bolts"
Alien Spacecraft theory for many UFO
sightings.

While the majority of reported
sightings almost definitely ARE
misperceived planes, lights, clouds
etc., there is still an overwhelming
body of evidence that supports the
thesis that we are not alone and that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------






someone else is visiting us.  Bear my
standpoint in mind, as it will almost
certainly colour my reporting of the
various lectures!  I will have to
cover the various speakers relatively
briefly, but I hope from this you can
get some idea of the event's
"flavour".

Back to Sheffield.  I was attending
the days events with my brother and
three other friends.  We had to travel
from Warrington, so we set off at
around a quarter to eight.  We made
pretty good time and arrived at the
University just before 9.30, when the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
days events were due to commence.

After the 400 or so attendees were in
and we had scoured the various
bookstands for some bargains, we made
our way to our seats.  After the
inevitable 20 minute delay, the host
for the two day's events appeared.
This was Phillip Mantle (who you may
have seen on the Johnathon Ross
programme "Fantastic Facts" recently).
After a quite well made video (which
didn't play very well, unfortunately,
due to the poor projection system),
Phillip told us the schedule for the
day and introduced the first speaker.

This was a Mr Ole Jonny Braenne, from
Norway.  He was talking about the
Spitsbergen UFO crash, which is
supposedly legendary, though none of
us had heard of it before.  He showed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
various newspaper headlines from the
time, though as most of them were in
German or Norwegian, they didn't mean
much and detailed the case.  After
about 40 minutes of build up, he said
that in his opinion the whole thing
was a hoax.  This (to us at least) was
a bit of a waste of time.  To give Ole
his due though, this was his first
ever presentation, let alone in
another country, so it was a good
effort.

The next speaker, Dirk Van Der Plas
from Belgium, had to cancel at the
last minute, so Phillip Mantle stood
in.  Phillip's presentation was very
interesting and humorous, especially
considering the short time he had to
prepare for it.  It also detailed some
of the hoax cases that UFO
investigators have to deal with.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a break was Hilary Evans, a well
known UFO author from the UK.  His
topic was UFO abductions and his
general thrust was that the so-called
abductees are actually externalising
their own inner turmoils and emotional
problems into these fictional alien
encounters.  Hmmmm.  Why people the
world over experience exactly the same
"delusions" despite vastly different
cultures and personal problems was not
really explained and is beyond me!
Personally, I would think the last
thing that someone would hallucinate
about to solve their own problems is
something that can, in some cases,
actually wreck their lives afterwards!

After lunch was Jenny Randles, also
from Warrington.  She's written over
20 books on the UFO and paranormal
subjects, and is Director of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Investigations for the British UFO
Research Organisation (BUFORA).  I
have heard her speak a few times and
she has also appeared on a few TV
programmes.  Her topic today was "The
Cheshire Window", detailing the
strange events going on with some
frequency around the Frodsham/Runcorn
area of North Cheshire.  This was
particularly interesting to us, as it
is only about 5 miles from where we
live.  Her talk was, as usual,
intelligent and informative.

We were then into the final two
speakers of the day, both from
America.  The first was Linda Moulton
Howe, whose main topic of conversation
was the cattle mutilation topic.
Actually this bizarre phenomenon
covers not only cattle, but just about
every type of domestic animal,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
including cats!  Satanic ritual has
been ruled out, as satanic mutilations
are usually very bizarre and messy.
These are clinically precise cuts,
with some form of laser cutting
equipment being used.  A mobile laser
surgery unit weighs around 500lbs,
requires two men to move and a
generator the size of a small car.
Hard to imagine a satanic group
carrying one of these into the middle
of a field, especially as no tracks
are found.  The other thing about the
cuts is that they are very precise and
bloodless.  Organs removed are most
commonly the eyes, lips, teats and
genitalia.  Embryonic fluid is also
removed from pregnant cows.  This
presentation was accompanied by some
pretty disturbing pictures of the
mutilated animals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The final and most interesting talk of
the day was from Budd Hopkins,
possibly the world authority on the
abduction scenario.  He presented the
case of Linda Cortila, who was taken
from a window 120 feet up in the air
in New York.  Accompanying her on her
trip at 3.15am were four small grey
beings.  The whole event was witnessed
by 2 secret servicemen (one of whom
later had a nervous breakdown) and a
woman whose car had broken down on the
Brooklyn Bridge.  No details have ever
been published and all witnesses came
forward independently.  Also shown was
an x-ray of Linda's nose which showed
a small hooked device which had been
implanted.  This was later removed,
before she could get the hospital to
do so.

This bizarre and highly visible event
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
was probably witnessed by many other
people, who are probably too scared to
come forward.  The investigation is
still ongoing and will be published
when it is finalised.  Interestingly
there was a third man in the car with
the two secret service guys, who has
so far been unnamed.  Budd Hopkins
says that if he was to come forward
with his testimony, that "the world
would change".  Although he is
unnamed, the UFO rumour mill suggests
that it may have been Perez de Cuela,
ex-general secretary of the U.N.!

We returned on the Sunday, where Linda
Moulton Howe and Budd Hopkins again
detailed some fascinating news from
the U.S. and elsewhere.  The first
speaker was the Reverend Donald
Thomas, who gave an interesting talk
on various well known cases.  He is
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
also an advocate of the alien
spacecraft theory.  Cynthia Hind, a
white South African from Zimbabwe
detailed some African and South
African abductions and noted that
although they have NO access to UFO
literature there, that people are
still reporting the same kind of
events as in America, England and the
rest of the world.

During the lunch break, Jenny Randles
again took to the stage, to show some
amateur videos that people had bought
along.

Paul Deveraux talked about
"Earthlights", a kind of free floating
energy, possibly an electrical plasma,
that forms near fault lines.  While an
interesting subject and well
substantiated by some solid research,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot agree with him that these
account for all UFO's.  Although these
may in the right conditions appear
metallic, I cannot believe that small
balls of light could be mistaken by
people such as astronomers and pilots
as large structured vehicles, with
windows and domes.

Andrew Collins was responsible for the
other sceptical viewpoint.  He has
done a lot of research into "Orgone"
energy, a kind of biological energy
force that lives in the atmosphere and
can be manifested under the right
conditions.  His research (continuing
the work done by William Wright in the
1950's) is similar to the Earthlights
mystery and again is quite interesting
in itself.  But when he started
talking about his research group
standing in a field meditating and
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"communing with ancestral spirits",
I'm afraid I couldn't really take it
seriously.  His talk of "Orgone
accumulators" and "Cloudbusters"
smacked far too much of new-age
mysticism for me and while an
interesting subject and possibly, as
with Earthlights, responsible for many
sightings, I cannot accept that all
UFO reports are down to this strange
"force".

The conference on the whole was very
interesting and enjoyable, and the
speakers from America again stole the
show, as did Bill Moore with his
lecture on the 1947 Roswell New Mexico
crash last year.  There were some down
points, however.  Firstly, a number of
the lectures were accompanied by audio
tapes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These were barely audible due to the
terrible P.A. system being used.  In a
similar way, the slide/video screen
was something like a white sheet,
which meant that whenever the sun came
out the picture was rendered almost
impossible to see.  Particularly
annoyed at the screen was Linda
Moulton Howe, who had some fascinating
film of a "UFO dogfight" that was
hardly visible.  I think that at 
9.50
per day each, a decent audio and
projection system is not too much to
expect, especially in a University!

I would recommend next year's event
(presuming there will be one) to
anybody interested in the UFO
phenomenon.  Many points of view are
presented, and you have to make up
your own mind based on the evidence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For those interested, BUFORA has a
weekly telephone bulletin presented
by Jenny Randles.  This can be heard
on 0891 121886.
