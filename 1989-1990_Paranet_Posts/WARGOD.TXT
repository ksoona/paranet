Here's  some  info  about  the (not) building of the Pyramid by Khufu...  taken
from Sitchin, "The Wars of Gods and Men", p.  136:

"The  current theories regarding the pyramids' builders are anchored to an even
greater  extent  on  the discovery of the name Khufu inscribed in hieroglyphics
within  a  long-sealed compartment within the Great Pyramid and thus apparently
establishing the identity of its builder.  Unnoticed has gone the fact that the
discoverer  of  that  inscription  was the same Colonel Vyse and his assistants
(the year was 1837).  [The preceding paragraph deals with the faking of a mummy
by  Vyse] In 'The Stairway to Heaven' we have put together substantial evidence
to  show  that the inscription was a forgery, perpetrated by its "discoverers."
At  the  end  of  1983,  a  reader of that book came forward to provide us with
family  records  showing  that  his  great-grandfather,  a  master  mason named
Humphries  Brewer,  who  was engaged by Vyse to help use gunpowder to blast his
way inside the pyramid, was an *eyewitness to the forgery* and, having objected
to the deed, was expelled from the site and forced to leave Egypt altogether!
	In  'The  Stairway  to  Heaven' we have shown that Khufu could not have
been  the builder of the Great Pyramid because he had already referred to it as
existing  in  his  time  in  a stela he had erected near the pyramids; even the
Sphinx,  supposedly  erected by the next-after successor of Khufu, is mentioned
in that inscription."

Comments?   Sitchin  has some very interesting theories on what the pyramid was
actually used for...  hold your breath...
