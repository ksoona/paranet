Apr. 5, 1966...Congressman,  Gerald Ford announces to Congress the need
to extensively examine UFOs.                                      
                                                                      
Apr.  17,1966...Ravenna,  OH,  to Conway,  Penn.:  Deputy Sheriffs Dale
Spaur  and  Wilbur Neff of Portage County were on patrol  when  an  UFO
stopped above them, illuminating them and the surroundings (it was just
about dawn). As the UFO moved away from them at about 300-500 ft. above
the road, it would alternately start and stop ahead of them playing cat
and mouse.  At E.  Palestine,  OH,  officer Wayne  Huston joined in the
pursuit.  At speeds of 100 mph in unfamiliar territory,  they were soon
low  on  gas and had to give up the game with the UFO.   Through  local
police  dispatch  the  officers alerted the Air Force,   who  sent  out
fighter  planes  to investigate the UFO.  As the officers  saw  the  AF
planes  approaching  the UFO shot straight up and out of  sight.   (see
6/24/66)                                                          
                                                                      
Summer,   1966...Results of an Iowa Poll,  Iowa:  45%   Iowans  queried
believe UFOs to be REAL objects.  Of the 45%,  21%  were of the opinion
that the UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin.                    
                                                                      
June,  1966.....Nha Trang,  Vietnam:  At this active Army Base at about
9:45  p.m.,  what was thought to be a flare lit up the north sky.   The
bright  UFO  approached  the  base alternately moving at  low  to  high
speeds.   Upon descending toward the soldiers it hovered at an altitude
of 300-500  ft.  All of a sudden the 6 generators failed along with the
engines  of  the idling Skyraiders,  (TESLA energy  discharge  effects)
bulldozers and trucks. The entire valley and surrounding mountains were
illuminated  by the hovering UFO for about 4 min.  after which it  went
straight up and disappeared in about 3 sec.  After the incident a plane
load of officials from Washington arrived to investigate. (see 3/4/69) 
                                                                    
June 24, 1966..Richmond, VA: Officer William L. Stevens, Jr.,  observed
a dirigible-shaped UFO at 3:30  in the morning near the fairgrounds. It
was about100  ft. long and 30 ft.  thick with greenish-yellow lights on
its perimeter.  Stevens attempted to chase the UFO but it maintained an
even  distance from him even though he sped up and slowed  down.   "The
object seemed to be playing CAT & MOUSE with me,"  he later said. After
10-15 min. the UFO accelerated and sped away. (see 4/17/66)       
                                                                    
Mar.  1, 1967...Lt. Gen. Hewitt T. Wheless, USAF,  sends notice to  all
branches of the military warning of persons imitating military officers
and  harassing  private citizens and  confiscating  UFO  photos.   (see
3/21/66)

Large walk-in refrigerator, empty body bags, men at work with technical
instruments.                                                      
                                                                      
JAN.  19, 1968..DIA Intelligence Report from Liaison in Moscow,  Russia
mentioning an attempt by the British Government in 1967  to collaborate
with the Soviets in UFO research. (see 2/22/68)                   
                                                                    
Feb. 22, 1968..UNCLASSIFIED AIRGRAM, U.S. Dept.  of the State regarding
UFOs in the Soviet Union:  Feb. 1968, Soviet Life published three pages
pertinent to UFOs,  by Felix Zigel.  He also published a UFO article in
1966. Until recently no study of UFOs had been made in the Soviet Union
(see 1/19/68)                                                     
                                                                      
1968...........Project xxxxxxxx (name CENSURED) established to evaluate
all    UFO   information   pertinent   to   space   technology.    (see
1953,12/69,1976)                                                  
                                                                      
Mar.   4,  1969...Near Atlanta,  Missouri:  The City Marshall and  Mail
Carrier in Elmer,  Missouri,  William R.  Overstreet observed an UFO at
early dawn over the road ahead of him.  It was about 100  ft.  in diam.
apparently rotating clockwise and emitting a strong white beam of light
down  to  the road which seemed to magnify the size of the road it  was
shining on.  He felt intense heat from the direction of the UFO and his
CB  radio was dead.  As he neared the light beam from the UFO his truck
motor and radio quit.  As the beammoved away from his truck he was able
to start the engine again.(TESLA energy discharge effects)  He followed
the UFO for about 4 mi.  staying away from the beam.  The UFO  followed
the  contour of the land it was flying over.  After 7-8  min.  the  UFO
veered  away and went out of sight.  "I had never believed in them  too
much until I saw this," he said. "Now I know that there is something to
these UFOs!" (see 8/13/75,6/66)                                   
                                                                      
1969?..........A  retired  Colonel from Wright-Patterson AFB  with  Top
Secret  clearance  states that a 2-man saucer crashed  near  Whitewater
Lake,   Indiana  as  a  result of  an  electrical  disturbance  in  the
atmosphere.                                                       
                                                                    
Dec.  1969......Project xxxxxx (name CENSURED)  continues after Project
BLUEBOOK is closed. (see 1968)                                    
                                                                    
Oct.  1969......Jimmy Carter sees and reports a UFO.  B1-E,516  CARTER,
JIMMY (Pres.)                                                     
                                                                      
1972...........Project  SNOWBIRD  established to test  fly  a  captured
flying saucer.                                                    
                                                                      
Oct.  2,  1972...A letter from the Dept.  of National Defence,  Canada,
Brig.   Gen.   L.A.  Bourgeois states:  All UFOs reported to  CFHQ  are
investigated  by  the Director of Operations.  It isn't a  practice  to
allow  the  public to study these files.  Since the beginning  of  1968
these UFO reports have been passed along to the NRC.  Evidence suggests
that  UFOs  present no threat to the Technology world.  They exhibit  a
unique scientifically advanced technology. (see 9/19/26)          
                                                                      
Sept.   ,1973....At Great Lakes Naval Base,  Instructor R.K.,   Gunnery
School Grade E-4,  while delivering a sealed envelope to the Commandant
in the quonset hut,  was surprised to see a saucer 30 ft. diam.  and 10
ft.  ht.  resting on a wooden platform.  Description:  Silvery blue and
shimmering,  it tapered like a teardrop with a flange running along its
topside  from  one end to the other and there were  no  windows.   R.K.
believed  this saucer to be the one shot down on its third pass over  a
Navy vessel by a missile.  The saucer crashed in 350 ft.  water between
Hawaii and the mainland. It was retrieved by a Glomar Explorer, shipped
to Hawaii then stateside to Chicago.                              
                                                                    
Oct.  18,  1973..Capt. Lawrence Coyne,  while flying an Army helicopter
with three other crewmen were 45  minutes out over Mansfield when Staff
Sgt.   Robert  Yanacsek spotted a red glowing UFO headed  toward  their
helicopter at an estimated 600  mph. It stopped abruptly 500 ft.  above
them.  It had a big,  gray,  metallic looking hull about 60  ft.  long,
shaped  like an airfoil or streamlined cigar with a red light in  front
and  a  green  light in the rear,  the lead edge  glowed  red  a  short
distance  from the nose.  There was a center dome.  The  'copter  radio
wouldn't  function  and the copter was set for a 20   degree  dive  but
gained altitude from 1700  ft. to 3500 ft. with no power applied. After
a slight "bounce" the UFO took off to the N.E.                    
                                                                    
Oct.  25,  1973..Director of FBI, Clarence M. Kelley, states:  UFOs are
not  and  never  has been a matter that  is  within  the  investigative
jurisdiction of the FBI.                                          
                                                                    
Jan.   8,  1975...CONFIDENTIAL Spanish Report,  Spanish Air Force:  UFO
spotted by military personnel at Las Bardenas Reales near Zaragoza  Air
Base.                                                             
                                                                      
Mar.   28,  1975..Letter from Senator Barry Goldwater stating:  Ten  or
twelve  years  ago  I tried to get access to the  building  at  Wright-
Patterson  (HANGER-18)   where  UFO  artifacts were stored  and  I  was
understandably denied access.  It is still classified above TOP SECRET.
I've  heard  they plan to release some of the information in  the  near
future and hope not to have to wait too much longer.              
                                                                      
Aug.  13,  1975..Near Haderslev,  Denmark:  Police Officer Evald Hansen
Maarup was driving home at 10:50 p.m.  when all of a sudden his car was
engulfed by a bright blue light while at the same time his car lost all
ower. The temperature in his car rose to that of a warm summer day and
his radio was dead so he couldn't call for help.  The bright beam  from
the  UFO was conical in shape with a bottom diam.  of 4-5  meters and a
top  diam.   at the UFO of 10  meters.  Two dome-like protrusions  were
visible  on  the  underside of the UFO that was hovering  at  about  20
meters altitude.  He activated a special camera on the patrol car which
automatically  took  3  pictures of the UFO.  As the UFO sped  away  he
regained  power to his car.  The developed film which was later  turned
over  to  the Danish AF showed the light source of the UFO on  it.   No
report or analysis has been available from the AF to date. (see 3/4/69)
                                                                    
Aug. 13, 1975..Alamogordo, NM: Staff Sgt. Charles L. Moody, USAF, drove
out to the outskirts of town late one night to watch for meteors.  As a
disc-shaped UFO descended toward him,  he tried to start his car to get
away but it wouldn't start.  He heard a high pitched whining sound from
the  UFO and saw shadowy figures in it and felt numbness,  after  which
the  UFO departed.  After driving home he found he couldn't account for
1.5  hours. The next day his back was enflame and he discovered a small
puncture wound over his spine and a few days later he developed a  body
rash.  As months passed he regained memory of the missing 1.5 hours. He
remembered that he had been in the UFO and in telepathic  communication
with small 4'8"  humanoids.  They had whitish gray skin,  large  heads,
large eyes,  small slit-like mouths and mask-like features. He had been
in a drug-like state  on  a table and they  had poked a rod like device
into  his back.  After this they escorted him about the ship and  later
dropped him off at his car. (see 3/4/69)                          
                                                                      
Oct. 28, 1975..CONFIDENTIAL CINC/NORAD Report: UFOs, suspicious objects
seen by ground personnel. Sounded like jet aircraft. Intermittent radar
contact  made  with  object.  Jets scrambled to intercept  but  objects
lights  went out interceptors passed and then came on again.  Then  the
object  increased in speed and raised to a high altitude and could  not
be discerned from the stars.  Description:  Through binoculars,  looked
like 100 ft. sphere and appeared to have craters around the outside. To
date, AF and SAC helicopters have failed to provide a positive I.D.  of
the UFO. (see 11/11/75,7/52)                                      
                                                                      
Oct.  29,  1975..NMCC Joint Staff Memo:  Subject:  AFB penetration.  At
290200  EST,  AFOC informed NMCC that an unidentified helicopter (UFO),
possibly two,  had been sighted flying low over Loring AFB,  Maine,  in
proximity to a weapons storage area. Army Nat. Guard helos called in to
assist in locating UFO. NORAD informed of the incident by SAC. Received
authority to proceed into Canadian airspace,  if necessary,  to  locate
UFO. A similar incident was reported the evening before.          
                                                                    
Nov. 11, 1975..CONFIDENTIAL CINC/NORAD Report. (see 10/28/75)     
                                                                      
Jan.  21,  1976..MEMO from NMCC by Rear Adm. J. B.  Morin stating:  Two
UFOs reported near the flight line at Cannon AFB, N.M.  Security Police
report the UFOs to be 25  yards (75  ft.)  in diameter,  gold/silver in
color with blue light on top,  hole in the middle and red light on  the
bottom.                                                           
                                                                      
Apr.  9, 1976...CONFIDENTIAL CIA Message: Source (name Censored)  seeks
guidance  from CIA UFO experts as to material in his report that should
remain classified.
