 Mr. KLASS:  Why?  If aliens are invading our bedrooms,
 impregnating our teenage girls; if they're abducting little
 children, cutting flesh samples out without even putting bandaids
 on; if you're not safe anywhere on the face of the earth - then it
 is something that this nation needs to mobilize.
 KING:  So you think it's a fantasy of Mr. Jacobs, or a fantasy
 of the people he's talked to?
 Mr. KLASS:  It's a combination of both.
 KING:  Now this is a respected professor of history-
 Mr. KLASS:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, indeed-
 KING:  -at a major American university.
 Mr. KLASS:  Indeed, but he has no training in psychotherapy
 except what he has recently acquired.  And what he is doing is
 trading unwittingly - I'm not accusing him of malice - unwittingly
 trading on psychologically disturbed people.  As he explained in
 one of his lectures - I think it was in Las Vegas or Pensacola; I
 don't recall - that many of his subjects are psychologically
 disturbed people.  They sometimes dream that they- or think that
 they leave their bodies in the company of angels or deceased
 relatives, that they- And, as a matter of fact, psychological tests
 show that people who make claims of UFO abductions report far more
 frequent sexual abuse as children.  They also, more than ordinary
 people, report that when they were children they saw strange
 entities or creatures that nobody else saw.
 KING:  So these are people with problems?
 Mr. KLASS:  These are people, generally-
 KING:  All right.
 David?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Well, it is actually sort of amazing, first of all,
 that he's sitting here and talking about my work and has not read
 my book.  I find that rather striking.  I would have to say,
 therefore, truly, everything that Mr. Klass has said is not true.
 Mr. KLASS:  So you have changed what you said at these
 conferences?  You have revised your papers?
 Mr. JACOBS:  I didn't say anything of the sort in my papers,
 either.
 KING:  OK, they're not psychologically disturbed?
 Mr. JACOBS:  No, they are not.  Obviously, everybody has
 problems.  Some people have more problems than others.  In the
 abduction phenomenon, it's completely random.  There are people who
 are very well adjusted.  There are people who are not well
 adjusted.  All of them have had a trauma that they try to deal
 with.  Yes, some of them have seen people - beings, whatever -
 standing around their bed.  They might interpret it as angels.
 They might interpret it as ghosts, whatever.  The fact is that
 psychological testing has shown that abductees - a small number,
 granted - were perfectly normal and exhibited no pathology.  We
 have psychiatrists and psychologist themselves who were abductees.
 It's just not true-
 KING:  Now wouldn't your case, though, David, be helped for Mr.
 Klass and others if a psychiatrist or a psychologist of renown came
 forward?
 Mr. JACOBS:  As an abductee?
 KING:  `Dr. Peterson' of New York city-
 Mr. JACOBS:  Oh, certainly.  That would be fine.
 KING:  -who's president of NYU; he was abducted.  Phillip's got
 to back off if Dr. Peterson walks in.
 Mr. JACOBS:  That would be fine.
 KING:  Why don't they come forward?
 Mr. JACOBS:  I can't control them.  This subject is steeped in
 ridicule.  It's about as ridiculous as one can get in this society.
 Anybody who goes forward is engaged in ridicule immediately,
 particularly in the work situation.  Why bother?  Why would they do
 that?
 KING:  Would you also agree, Phil, on the other side, that
 skeptics-
 Mr. KLASS:  But I-
 KING:  Wait a minute- have always existed?  If we were doing
 this show in 1907 and Orville and Wilbur called in from a bike shop
 in Kitty Hawk and said they flew, we'd all laugh.
 Mr. KLASS:  No.  No.
 KING:  We wouldn't?
 Mr. KLASS:  No, we wouldn't, because there were a number of
 other experiments.  A Dr. Langley was experimenting with aircraft
 just on the outskirts of Washington.  But in view of David's
 denial, let me read verbatim what he said at the 1988 MUFON {sp?
 
 UFO conference, Lincoln, Nebraska:
 {Reads
  `It is common for abductees to feel that they in some
 way left their body, usually during the night in bed.  When they
 floated out of their bed they were often accompanied by someone who
 they interpret as being a deceased relative or an angel.'
 Going on from the same talk, {Reads
  `A few claim that they
 have experienced astral travel, as well.  At one minute they were
 in one spot, and then seemingly the next instant they were in
 another plane-'
 KING:  All right, I don't want to read all that.
 Do you want to respond?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Yes.  No, well, that's absolutely true.  Yes, I
 agree, that's- That doesn't mean that they're psychologically
 disturbed.
 KING:  That doesn't mean they're psychologically troubled, Phil.
 It just means that's the experience they shared in common with
 other people who had it happen to them.
 Mr. KLASS:  Well, this- Pardon me- Pardon me-
 KING:  That in itself means psychologically troubled to you?
 Mr. KLASS:  I do have the quotes here, he referred to them
 as psychologically disturbed.  He also went on to say some of
 these people get satisfaction in the fringe aspects of the popular
 UFO scene-
 KING:  Some.
 Mr. KLASS:  -that they attend psychic conferences; that they
 engage in channeling; and that some of them become channelers,
 allegedly talking with ancient people and so on.
 KING:  OK, let's get some calls in here.
 Florence, Italy, hello.
 4th CALLER: {Florence, Italy
  Good evening.  First to Mr.
 Jacobs.  Do you, yourself, have a firm belief in UFO's?  Secondly,
 how much of this study was a commercial venture for you?
 Mr. JACOBS:  I have been involved with studying the UFO
 phenomenon for about 27 years.  A commercial venture?  None of it
 was a commercial venture.  This is what's called a negative
 cashflow business.  The money just flows out of your wallet.
 There's no funding for this, to speak of.  There's no science
 organizations that will do anything about it.
 KING:  So you're not making- If the book sells, you would make
 money, but you have not to this point made money?
 Mr. JACOBS:  I will not make up the money that I have spent
 doing this research.
 KING:  You don't question that David believes?
 Mr. KLASS:  No.  No, that I don't question.
 KING:  In other words, David isn't writing a hoax book?
 Mr. KLASS:  Oh, no.
 KING:  He interviewed people-
 Mr. KLASS:  Indeed, indeed, indeed.  I think he's doing a great
 disservice to the people of this country.
 KING:  Should he reveal the names of all these people?
 Mr. KLASS:  That is up to them, but he could reveal his data to
 fellow UFO believers and, in fact, there is a critical article in
 the latest issue of the MUFON UFO journal criticizing David and Bud
 Hopkins-
 KING:  Why don't you, David?
 Mr. KLASS:  -for not making their data available.
 KING:  All right.  David?
 Mr. JACOBS:  Well, what that article states, basically, is that
 one of the UFO organizations wants cases and they're wondering why
 I don't send them in the cases.
 KING:  It's normal to want that.
 Mr. JACOBS:  Right, that's true, and the problem is that many of
 these accounts are really very personal in nature.  However, I have
 told the author of that article that I will participate.
 KING:  We'll be right back with David Jacobs, author of Secret
 Life:  Firsthand Accounts of UFO Abductions, and Phillip Klass,
 contributing editor to Aviation Week, and some more of your calls,
 as well.  Don't go away.
 
 {Commercial break
 
 
 KING:  Welcome back.  Our guests are David Jacobs of Temple
 University, history professor and author of Secret Life; and
 Phillip Klass, contributing editor to Aviation Week.
 We go back to the calls.  Washington, D.C., hello.
 5th CALLER: {Washington, D.C.
  Hello.  Gentlemen, several
 months ago CNN broadcast a clip released from NASA that was shot
 during the STS-48 and this film showed several objects that moved
 in rather bizarre ways.  I wonder if either one of you have seen
 this video?
 KING:  Phillip?
 Mr. KLASS:  No, I have not, but it certainly would have created
 a great furor in the trade press and in the news media, and we
 would have heard more about it.
 Mr. JACOBS:  No, I'm not familiar with the tape.
 KING:  Are you saying, Phillip, that if this were a real story
 we'd have all known about it by now?
 Mr. KLASS:  If it was on CNN and really-
 KING:  No, I don't mean this story-
 Mr. KLASS:  Oh.
 KING:  -I mean the whole UFO story.
 Mr. KLASS:  Well, let me say I would like to focus on the claims
 of abduction because those who join up with David Jacobs and his
 associates- It's a cult.  Their life will be accursed for as long
 as they live because the dogma of this cult is that if you have
 been abducted they will come back and get you, no matter whether
 you put in burglar alarms, no matter where you are.  They will
 abduct your children-
 KING:  All right, let David respond to that.
 Mr. KLASS:  -when they grow up and become parents, they will
 abduct the grandchildren.
 KING:  This is just a cult of people who are- These are
 abductees?  They don't bother with strangers?
 Mr. JACOBS:  {Laughs
  If it is a cult, they forgot to send me
 my membership. I don't enjoy this.  This, as my colleague Bud
 Hopkins says, is a daily dose of pain-
