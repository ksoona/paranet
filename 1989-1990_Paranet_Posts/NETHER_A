- Economy
Overview: Tourism, petroleum refining, and offshore finance are the
mainstays of the economy. The islands enjoy a comparatively high per
capita income and a well-developed infrastructure compared with other
countries in the region. Unlike many Latin American countries, the
Netherlands Antilles has avoided large international debt. Almost all
consumer and capital goods are imported, with the US being the major
supplier. The economy has suffered somewhat in recent years because
of the depressed state of the world oil market and declining tax revenues.
In 1983 the drop in oil prices led to the devaluation of the Venezuelan
bolivar, which ended a substantial flow of Venezuelan tourists to the
islands. As a result of a decline in tax revenues, the government has
been seeking financial support from the Netherlands.
