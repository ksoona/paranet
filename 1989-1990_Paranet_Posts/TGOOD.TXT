Roy Cokes started off with asking Tomothy Good about the so-called
Mars conspiracy. Does the NASA actually hide information about
the Mars probes that lost contact with earth, because they obtained
futtage throught this probe that might be somewhat disturbing to the
public?
Timothy himself doesn't really believe the NASA destroyed that recent
probe on purpose or just acts if they lost contact with it in order
to hide information about possible UFOs or alien lifeforms.
However, the pictures taken by the Voyager probes some years ago are 
very interesting and probably prove that there was an ancient civilisation
on Mars somewhen, probably thousands or millions of years ago.
Proof for this might be the so-called "Mars Face" and the Pyramids in the
Sandorian region on Mars. Although he doesn't think the Mars face is 
supposed to be a human face, he has no explanation for it.

Next they went over to the topic of those mysterious crop circles.
Timothy commented that the majority of these corn field circles and
figures have been faked. Although, not all of them seem to be hoaxes,
there still remain some that can't be explained with this theory saying
it's all fakes. According to him there is some evidence hinting at UFOs
being the reason for some of these circles, although he is unable to give
any further explanations.

Related to this, they showed a video taken by some English guy a couple
of years ago. This same guy was live on the phone when they showed the
video. 

Ok, what he said was that he and his wife heard of some crop circle
in a near-by corn field, and because of being curious they drove out there
with their video camera to film it. 
On the video one sees this strange figure in the field, and then
suddenly the guy seems to have spotted this small(Approx. 15" in diameter)
shiny, metal-like object flying just over the crop field. He moved the 
camera into that direction and filmed all of it. You see this disc-shaped
object flying over the field, sometimes diving into the field, then
surfacing again, one actually saw the corn moving when the object
touched it while maneuvering over it and diving into it. Then suddenly,
it began moving up, gaining height, like a couple of feet. It went
on moving to the hedges at the end of the field, into the direction of the
hills. There was a tractor moving down a way there, a farmer driving it.
The object flew directly over the tractor, catching more height. The
farmer described the object as being made of shiny metal and shaped
like a disc, defenitely controlled by some kind of intelligence.

Timothy said this object might be related to the crop figure in that very
field. It was probably intelligently maneuvered and by no means was a
bird, mirror and anything like that. Something similar looking and
behaving has already been observed during a Concorde flight over England.

The english guy who filmed all this said he isn't exactly sure what this
thing was, it doesn't necessarly need to be of alien origin, but it 
surely is something very strange.

After that, Timothy went on giving information on updates on the UFO
topic from the recent past. He e.g. said, that Gorbachev, former
president of the former Soviet Union confirmed the reality of the UFO
phenomenon. He said we should not ridicule it and must take it very serious.
He even admitted that he himself ridiculed it together with Ronald
Reagan in the past and that they discussed the possibility of defending
earth together against alien aggressors.

Furthermore, there have been several sightings over Rumania. The UFOs seen
there are said to have caused power failures in near-by cities/villages.

Also there were sightings over Puerto Rico just a few years ago,
a high Air Force officer from Puerto Rico came up since he was fed
up with all that cover up stuff and admitted he whitnessed several UFOs
being chased by US Air Force interceptors. He also knew about UFOs
diving into a lake there several times. Timothy said the aliens
may have another base just in that sea in Puerto Rico.

From then on, several viewers joined the program live via the phone
to ask questions and to state their opinions.

Andy from England.
Andy: "This object on the video cassete was just a silver baloon, being 
       moved around by wind. That's the only explanation for this!"
T. Good: "Experts analyzed the film frame by frame and they came to the
	  conclusion that this object has been moved in an intelligent manner,
	  plus it has been made out of metal and it was disc-shaped in
	  appearance. Its movement couldn't be explained away with a
	  plain silver baloon moving around in the wind!"
Andy: "I personally don't believe in all these UFO stories. If there
       really are other life forms in this universe, why would they come
       around our little planet and waste their time with us?"
(Note: Why do we humans 'waste' our time with conducting extensive research
       on animals etc?)

Katherine from Germany.
Katherine: "Why would Reagan & Gorbachev think about defending earth
	    against aliens? Do we have reason to believe that some of
            the aliens come here with evil intentions? If we take for
	    granted that these life forms are intelligent shouldn't
	    they refrain from using violence?"
T. Good: "Some of these alien species are defenitely dangerous. We must
          not be that naive and believe they all come here with the best 
	  intentions, like ironing out all our problems and creating
	  paradise here on earth. There is proof that some of these
	  species actually abduct humans and even harm them.
	  Most of them seem to be friendly, some just look very similar
	  to us humans, other look like nothing on earth."

Colin from England.
Colin: "It was during the christmas time some years ago, I was going
	home near Heathrow Airport, it was about 2 to 3 am. I suddenly
	stopped as I spotted a bright orange light over the ground.
	I first thought it might have been something like an explosion,
	but after 3-4 minutes this light just sped up into the sky and
	then vanished. It surely was no plane. Shortly after that there
	were helicopters, I don't know what kind of, I couldn't make
	out any signs on them since it was dark, in the entire area,
	just as if they came to check out where the light went. Whatever
	this was, I've never seen something like that ever before."
T.Good: "This sounds pretty interesting to me. You probably are into planes 
	 since you live so close to the airport and you can tell if
	 something is an ordinary plane or not. Especially the helicopers
	 observing the whole area afterwards sound pretty interesting."
  
In the meantime they received a fax from a viewer at home saying the object
they showed on the videocassete at the beginning might have been a model
helicopter.
T.Good: "This explanating is utter non-sence. This disc, and it was a disc
	 as the farmer confirmed, dived into the field several times.
	 If it were a small model helicopter with rotor blades it would have
	 crashed immedeatly and couldn't have moved through and over the
	 field like the object on the film did."

Then they talked about a new movie dealing with the UFO topic 
called 'Far In The Sky'. It tells the story of a man being abudcted 
by aliens for 5 whole days for examination.
Good went on explaining that this movie is based on the so-called
"Travis Walton"-case from Novemeber 1985. Back then 6 people were said
to have an encounter with an UFO in Arizona, USA. One of them, Travis Walton
just ran into the direction the UFO. Then suddenly, as the remaining 5
whitnesses reported later, a light beam has been emmited from the UFO
that zapped Travis. He sank to the ground obviously unconscious and then
vanished. He has been found again 5 days later. Under hypnosis he reported
he has been examined by aliens in that space ship for those 5 days.

Stella from Holland.
Stella: "Concerning this theory of evolution, is it possible that
	 these aliens actually created us humans, like through
	 cross-breeding primates like apes with genetic information of
	 themselves. This would solve lots of mysteries being described
	 in the bible."
T. Good: "Some people who claim they had contact with aliens say they
	  have been told exactly this, i.e. that aliens conducted genetic 
	  manipulations with the primates living on earth thousands of years
	  ago and we humans are just the result of that!"	

Nicole from Germany.
Nicole: "I am convinced that there is life on other planets in the
	 universe as well. I am sure the governments know more than
	 they say they do but they don't reveal everything and keep
	 the public in the dark. Why do they do that?
T. Good: "Well, this whole UFO topic is the greatest cover-up of all
	  times. Ten thousands of UFO documents are being released right
	  now under the freedom of information act. You know this is a 
	  very sensitive topic, information about the crashed discs from
	  the 1950s were already classified Above Top Secret back then
	  and still are today."
Nicole: "Why do they keep it all secret?"
T. Good: "Probably the public would overreact when all the facts would be
	  revealed. It would also touch religious acpects of our life
	  that might be very disturbing for e.g. the church. Also this
	  would be pretty embarrasing for the politicians. They'd have to
	  talk about something they don't entirely understand.
	  Furthermore, the US government has obtained technological
	  knowledge from some of these crashed discs, and of course they
	  won't reveal that to everybody."

Stefan from Belgium. 
T. Good: "Oh, you're calling from Belgium. There were a lot of sightings
	  there in 1989, about 2500 reports are available from there. And
	  these UFOs were not just lights, but real huge structural objects,
	  as being observed by police officers, Beligan Air Force officers
	  etc. In a press conference in 1990 the Belgian Air Force admitted 
	  that these objects observed back then were real and released
	  radar material showing a F16 interceptor chasing an UFO suddenly
	  dropping from about 2000 to about 200 meters in less than one
 	  second. No conventional flying object could perform this."
Stefan: "Yeah, I've heard about that. Now to my actual question, what
	 about the enigma of the Bermuda Triangle? Is it in any repsect
	 related to the UFO phenomenon?"
T. Good: "Well, in my opinion a lot has been exagarated when it came to
	  the Bermuda Triangle. However, some cases seem to be real and
	  there is probably something true to them."

Christian from Norway.
Christian: "If everything is so secret, how come people like you know
	    so much?"
T. Good: "Under the Freedom of Information Act some information can be
	  obtained and I and my colleagues were able to gather much more
	  secret information through e.g. former CIA representatives that
	  leak out information they had access to etc."
Christian: "Why are there so many different shapes and forms of these
	    UFOs and why are there some many alien species? This doesn't
	    make things very credible to me."
T. Good: "I can't explain it. If we are to believe the numerous whitnesses
	  we must accept the fact of the existence a mulititude of
	  differently shaped space ships and alien races"

George from Greece.
George: "I think it's pretty selfish of some of the people to believe
	 that we're unique in the universe being the only intelligent
	 lifeform around, I find that pretty arrogant. Well, what
	 about these sightings in the vicinity of the sea and about 
	 UFOs actually diving into the sea?"
T. Good: "I am glad you brought this up, George. Well, we indeed call
	  these objects USOs(Unidentified Sea Objects), they dive right
	  into the sea. From that we might conclude that there maybe
	  bases under the surface of sea."


That was the last call they received and that was all they had time for.
Cokes emphasized that all of the viewers that want to obtain more
profound information on the UFO topic should go ahead and get a hold
of Good's books, e.g. "Above Top Secret", "Alien Liason" or "Alien
Update".
