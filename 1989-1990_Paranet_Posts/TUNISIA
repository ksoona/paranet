- Economy
Overview: The economy depends primarily on petroleum, phosphates, and
tourism for continued growth. Two successive drought-induced crop
failures have strained the government's budget and increased
unemployment.  The current account fell from a $23 million surplus in
1988 to a $390 million deficit in 1989. Despite its foreign payments
problems, Tunis appears committed to its IMF-supported structural
adjustment program. Nonetheless, the government may have to slow its
implementation to head off labor unrest.  The increasing foreign
debt--$7.6 billion at yearend 1989--is also a key problem. Tunis
probably will seek debt relief in 1990.
