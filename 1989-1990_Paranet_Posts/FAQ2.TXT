=== 0.1: About alt.alien.visitors
---------------------------------
alt.alien.visitor is a Usenet discussion group available through internet.
Currently a.a.v. is the only UFO related discussion group available on
Usenet. It caters to a wide rage of UFO related discussion from New Age
UFOlogy to Scientific UFOlogy. It currently receives around 36 posting
daily. All comments by me are indicated by the square brackets[].

Alt.alien.visitors is received by people in many different countries. 
Different countries use different formats for dates.  In the USA, for
example, people would read 3/7/93 as the 7th day of March 1993.  In
the UK the same string would mean the 3rd day of July 1993. Confusion
will be reduced if people always quote the month either in full or
by the first three letters e.g. 3 Aug 93.

=== 0.2: Posting to alt.alien.visitors
--------------------------------------
The following idea was suggested by matthews_k@cubldr.colorado.edu and is
taken from mwauford@UTKUX1.UTK.EDU (Melissa Wauford)'s "*** REC.ARTS.TV
POSTING GUIDELINES ***". I have adapted it to fit alt.alien.visitors, and
I feel that this is an excellent idea. I would recommend that you use this
system when posting to alt.alien.visitors.

alt.alien.visitors can be a controversial newsgroup with a wide variety
of discussed topics. A few topics may generate more traffic than others
and may contain subject matter related to UFOlogy that others wish to
filter out or concentrate upon.  In order to allow those who use rn or
some other method of pre-selecting articles to filter out (or save away)
postings about these heavy traffic subjects, an abbreviation scheme has
been created.  Please help out by starting your subject line with one of
the following abbreviations when posting about these topics. For example:

Subject: HOT - Dancing Aliens

or

Subject: OP: Grey finger snacks,(the trick is in how you fold them)

New abbreviations will be added as needed. Send suggestions directly to
me, and I'll add them to the list. Objections to any abbreviations should
probably be posted so that a consensus may be reached. Old abbreviations
will be deleted when no longer necessary.


Suggested Abbreviations by matthews_k@cubldr.colorado.edu:
[revised by Fsdlk@acad3.alaska.edu]

 ABD = Abduction information
  CE = Pertaining to UFO sightings and phenomena, Close Encounters,
       alien contact
  HA = Jokes & silliness
 HOT = Someone flaming someone else
 INV = Postings about alien invasions and conspiracies 
MISC = Other categories like Atlantis/Mu/Spacemen, etc...
  NA = New Age stuff NEWS = UFO related news, upcoming conventions.
  OP = Opinions
 REP = Repostings of older post like Lear, Cooper, etc..
 SCI = Scientific (preferably not pseudo) findings on UFO related issues


== 0.4: Common Sense Guidelines
-------------------------------
When posting to any Usenet group please follow these general guidelines.

(1)  Do not post on subjects that clearly unrelated to the newsgroup.
     Take them to the appropriate news group for discussion.

     Example: Discussion of abortion, gun control, politics and other
     strictly non related UFO should not be posted on this news group.

(2)  Do not completely repost others peoples postings and then write your
     opinion about it. Selectively edit the the post to get the information  
     you need from it to make your point. The standard symbol used to show
     information from another post is the ">".

     Example of what not to do: Repost a long section of material quoted
     from a previous article, followed by "I agree" or words to that
     effect.

   and smile. Someone is always a little worse off than you are and here is
   one sure fired place to find one.
I) People who are not contactees, or new-agers, or sceptics, but are simply

===Terminology and Definitions Used in UFOlogy
----------------------------------------------

2.00: Astronomical Units (A.U.)
------------------------------
An A.U. is a measurement of space. One A.U. is the distance from the earth
to the sun.

2.01: a.a.v.
------------
alt.alien.visitors One of the many Usenet discussion groups.

2:02: Close Encounters (CE) & Visual Sightings
----------------------------------------------

The main classification of UFO reports in use is based upon one used by
Dr J. Allan Hynek in his book "The UFO Experience" (Aberlard-Schuman 1972).
It should be noted that many other classification systems have been devised
by other researchers. Briefly the Hynek system  is :

NL (nocturnal light)
   A simple visual sighting of a unidentified flying light seen at night.

ND (nocturnal disc)
   A simple visual sighting of a unidentified flying extended or structured
   light source seen at night. (This is an extension to Hynek's system).

DD (daylight disc)
   A simple visual sighting of a UFO with distinct shape seen during the day.

Radar Cases
   UFOs detected by Radar
   
Radar Visual Cases
   UFOs observed visually whilst being simulataneously on radar. From Hynek's
   study these make up 1 to 2% of reports.
   
Close Encounters of the first kind (CE1, CEI)
   As first defined by Hynek, a CE1 is an observation of a UFO within 150
   yards.

Close Encounters of the second kind (CE2, CEII)
    A UFO which leaves some form of physical evidence
    Example: A burn where the UFO appeared to touch the ground or the finding 
    of material of unknown makeup.

Close Encounters of the third kind (CE3, CEIII)
    A visual sighting of an occupant or entity associated with a UFO. An 
    analysis by Hynek  of 650 reports found only 1% to be CE3
    
(Close Encounters beyond the third kind are extensions to the basic Hynek
system. Different authors have used the same designation to mean different 
things.)

Close Encounters of the forth kind (CE4, CEIV)
    An abduction of an individual by an alien being or race.


Close Encounters of the fifth kind (CE5, CEV)
    A direct contact or communication with alien being or race.
    Example: Billie Meier with the Pleiadians, U.S.Govt. with the
    Greys, or channeling.

2:03: Marfa Lights
------------------
Marfa lights  are balls of lights that appear, change different colors
and dance around in the air.  These lights where named after the town
that they have been appearing in, Marfa Texas. They have also been sited
in other areas. Some theories as to what they are include Ball lighting,
Car headlights, and Alien space ships. The last current sighting I'm
aware of was Marfa Texas on September 1 1992.

A small booklet on the Marfa Lights has been written by Dennis Stacey,
editor of the MUFON Journal, discussing many of the cases and the theories.  
For details contact the author or MUFON.

2:03: Men In Black (MIB)
------------------------
These are a group of individuals who are said to wear black suits and
drive and fly around in unmarked black cars and helicopters.  They go
about  threatening people who have claimed to have seen UFOs into not
talking about what they witnessed.

The very first occurrence of MIB was traced to a man named Albert K.
Bender.  He was the editor of a flying saucer publication called the
"Space Review" In the October 1953 issue he placed an announcement
stating that he had come across information that would solve the flying
saucer mystery but they could not print it because they were ordered not
to.  They then ended the announcement warning others in saucer work to be
"very cautious"  they then stopped their publications. Later in an
interview Bender stated that "three men wearing dark suits" had ordered
him to stop publishing flying saucer material, and  that he had complied
with the order because he had been "scared to death" of them. He later
published a book called "Flying Saucers and the Three Men in Black"

2:05: Tectonic Strain Theory (TST)
----------------------------------
A theory of electromagnetic effects upon the human brain and/or the
physical environment, such that all Forteana including UFOs, ghosts, ESP,
sasquatch, and religious fervour can be explained as being caused by
seismic activity generating electromagnetic radiation which in turn makes
people think they are witnesses to an anomalous event. Alternatively, the
EMM radiation can luminesce so that it appears as a UFO.  Chief
proponent: Michael Persinger. A variant is the "Earth Lights" hypothesis
described by Paul Devereux.

UFO
------
Unidentified Flying Object. Official term used by the Air Force.
Something seen in the sky (or on the land, or expceptionally in the water, 
but thought capable of flight) which the witness could not identify and 
thought sufficently strange to report to either an offical or unoffical
investigating body. The stimulus for a UFO report.

2:06: UFOnauts
-------------- 
A term used by the UFO community in reference to the alien abductors or
extraterrestrials.

2:07: Unusual Ground Markings (UGM)

=== Alien Races 
---------------------
These are often talked about in books, Publications and on this discussion
group. [Much of this material is high speculative - SG]


3.00: Arcturus
--------------
Members of Confederations of Humans [will do more research later]

  Issue # 371

3.01: Aryans (Blondes)
----------------------
Blond Nordic Humanoids who work with the greys. Said to be captured by
the Reptoids and also have implants. They are said to have a tendency to
switch their loyalties between the Reptoids and the Confederations of
Humans.

3.02: Bllues (Star Warriors)
----------------------------
The Blues are said to have translucent skin, large almond shaped eyes and
small of stature. The main issue of their teaching was PURSUE YOUR
PASSION, follow your own way, do your own thing, don't be pressured into
being anything but what and who you are.

The information about the Blues comes from Robert Morningsky a
Hopi/Apache dancer. According to Morningsky the first alien contact
started about 1947 - 1948 with the Greys contacting the U.S. Government
to form a treaty with them. Another body of Aliens arrived, called the
Blues. The Blues advised the government not to deal with the greys saying
it would only lead to disaster. They told the U.S. to follow your own
path. They said they would would teach with peace and harmony if men
would disarm and listen. The military said no deal. So they left, but a
few decided to remain and stayed in Northern Mexico and Arizona and made
a treaty with the Hopi Indians. These Aliens are known by the Hopi as
Star Warriors. The greys started monitoring the Blues. So the Blues had
to flee the reservation and go into hiding, a few of the Elders went with
them.

The Hopi legend is that there were two races, the children of the feather
who came from the skies, and the children of the reptile who came from
under the earth. The children of the reptile chased the Hopi Indians out
of the earth, these evil under-grounders were also called two hearts.

3.03: Confederation of Humans
------------------------------
An organization of alien groups born out of positive energy, that are
helping the human race along and desire to protect them.  Includes:
Vega, Arcturus, Sirius, Pleiades and other humanoids.

3.04: Greys
-----------
This is the most commonly identified alien race in UFOlogy. Their are
many different views, stories and theories regarding them ranging from
the different New Age views to the different Scientific, and conspiracy
views.

Greys as presented by the Scientific Community:
 The Greys are the most commonly described race by abduction victims. In
this view they are considered a race with an unknown motives, and
agendas. They seem to be abducting, studying, testing and using various
individuals for their one unclear reasons. [See: Abductions and Current
Theories]

Greys as presented by the New Age Movement:
  In the new age movement the Greys are often associated as an evil race,
or a race with bad energy. They are often associated with many other
races, such as the Reptoids and their motives are known.

Greys as presented by Different Conspiracy Theories
  The different conspiracy theories are often a mix of the scientific and
new age views. The standard conspiracy base states that the Greys crashed
one or more of their space ships and they were found by the U.S.
Government. The Government them makes a secret treaty with the Greys
allowing them to abduct humans in exchange for their technology. The
conspiracy theories often end with the Greys not keeping their part of
the deal. [I will try and include some of the different conspiracy
theories when I have more time to research them in detail]

Their are descriptions of several types of Greys: they are all humanoid in
appearance, a head, main body, two arms, hands, legs, and feet.

1: The most commonly seen grey is around two to four feet tall, very
slender and delicate looking, small beings and light weight, extremely
penetrating black slanted eyes with no pupils, almost vestigial mouth
and nose, a very large head with a pointed chin. The skin color varies
from dark grey to light grey, tan to tanish grey, white to pale white.
They have no hair on their bodies.

2: Another commonly seen Grey is described similarly as above, except
their usually six inches taller, and seem to give the orders. A variation
of this same described individual is: same as above except eyes like big
black buttons and are rounded.

3: Another type of Grey are the small robot like beings, stocky and
little, with smooth rounded hat on top, with dark deep set holes for eyes
and a round O shaped mouth, square breastplate with concentric circles on
it, smell like burnt match heads, mushroom grey skin. These Greys are
often said to act like security guards.

Other variations are described as Reptilian like with claws an preying
mantis like. There have also been many report of cross breeds that are
not exactly human and not exactly Greys.

the grays. [If this is wrong someone please correct me, I'll do more
research on this later]

3.06: Pleiadians
---------------- 
The Pleiadians are a collective of extraterrestrials from the star system
Pleiades. They are also from various times in our future, starting from
500 years from now to millions of years from now. The Pleiadian culture
is ancient and was "seeded" from another universe of love long before
Earth was created. They have formed a tremendous society which operates
with love, with ideas and ideals that we are yet unfamiliar with.

The Pleiadians started a project to contact and inspire earth humans to
take back their power and create a better reality for themselves. They
are here as ambassadors from another universe to help Earth through her
transition from the third dimension to the fourth dimension and to assist
each of us in our personal endeavors of awakening, remembering and
knowing. As this project has become more successful, more ETs have
joined the group, some from other systems. The group later changed its
name from Pleiadians to the Pleiadians Plus.

The Pleiadians say that their reasons for contacting us is that there is
a chance of tyranny in the future and they are coming back to inspire us
as much as possible so we will take charge of creating our own reality
and change the future.
   They teach a very empowering form of personal and social metaphysics,
with love and clarity. The Pleiadians speak as a collective and there are
no individuals identified. They do not appear in physical form although
they say they can. They say it is safer to come through the channel,  and
it does not attract as much attention.


Billie Meier's Contact from the Pleiades 
Billie Meier was contacted over 130 times between 1976 and 1982 by a
female named Samjese who said she was from the star system Pleiades. She
was the first to telepathically contact Meier and tell him where to go
for the first physical contact. Meier had indepth conversations with
Samjese. The contact notes are published in following four books and are
out of print:

UFO ... Contact from the Pleiades Vol I & II Photo Journals (Vol I is in
        its second printing.) 
UFO ... Contact from the Pleiades Prilimary Investigation Report 
UFO ... Contact from the Pleiades Supplementary Investigation Report 
Message From the Pleiades Vol 1 & 2 Light Years

There are 4 videos available on the Pleiades case. 
Contact        $59.
The Beamship Trilogy   $99. 
The videos are available from: 
Genesis III Publishing, P.O. Drawer JJ, Munds Park, AZ 86017
[Also see: The Pleiades Project]

There is also a book available called Bringers of the Dawn - Teachings
from the Pleiadians by Barbara Marciniak.  They also have 2 to 3 hundred
tapes available.

3.08: Reptoids
---------------
A reptilian race from Draco bent on conquest,  They are said to be
controling the greys by means of an implant, the same one that the gray
are implanting into humans.  They are also said to be the master minds
behind the abduction plans. Their master plan involves using the newly
created 'Half-breeds' with implants to defeat the Confederations of
Humans. The Reptoids also use humans as food.  [Does this remind you of
the movie V?]

=== Abductions and Current Theories
-----------------------------------
4.00: About Abductions
----------------------
There are many people who believe they have been abducted by UFOnauts.
These abduction victims often experience memory loss and "missing time".
some of them have been able to recall their abductions from memory and
others have recalled their abductions by the aid of hypnosis. Often these
encounters involve being taken aboard an alien craft and examined by the
UFOnauts and put through a variety of physical and mental procedures.
Then the individuals are returned. Many of the abduction victims has
shown signs of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

Some of the major researchers who have studied the abduction field
include Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs, Leo Sprinkle, John Mach, Philip Klass, 
John Spencer and Jenny Randles.

There are several groups with distinct opinions. The dyed-in-the-wool
Skeptics, who who don't believe it. Others who are passing no verdict, but
are still examining  the evidence. Those who believe due to the
similarities of the abduction testimonies. Those who claim to have
information through means such as channeling. Those who claim to have had
first-person experiences, with automatic conscious recall. Those who
claim to have had first-person experiences, with recall under hypnotic
regression.

The opinions of some skeptics such as Klass believe that the hypnotists
themselves are leading the abduction victims unknowingly into believing
that they have had an abduction experience. The skeptics believe that the
the media has been saturated so much with the abduction material that when
people having nightmares or people who believe that they have experienced
the "missing time" are put under hypnosis, they draw upon what they have
seen in the media to fulfill the expectations of the hypnotist and
causes themselves to be put trough the trauma for that reason. They say
the nightmares are often caused by the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, and
the "missing time" is not an uncommon experience and is caused when the
mind is preoccupied by other matters. They often give the advice to go to
clinical doctors, and not to contact an abductionist.

Other researchers such as Jacobs and Hopkins believe that there is
something physical causing the abduction experiences. Hobkins has stated
that he believes that the abduction are real and that the recounts of the
abductions are to similar to each other to be anything but the truth.
Jacobs takes a slightly different approach, he has been categorizing all
the accounts and trying to find patterns in the testimonies. Through this
method he come up with new more indepth theories regarding the
abductions. 

The Channelers believe that the abductions are part of a battle between
good energy forces and evil energy forces. [See Reptoids, Greys and
Pleiadians]

There people on the net who believe they have had personal experiences
with Alien contacts or abductions. Some have posted accounts of their
experiences. Many others decline to post due to attacks by skeptics.

There has been possible material evidence of UFOs or Alien contacts. There
are abundant material traces, even excepting those confiscated by the
military. Material traces include burned grass and earth where UFOs have
landed, UFOs shown on radar tapes, UFOs on film and in photos. Bodily
traces on abductees include scoop-marks in the flesh, incisions, burns,
apparent radiation exposure, bruises, inflammation, etc. Whether any of
these is considered *evidential*, however, is a subjective value call.

For anyone who is interested in abduction help call:

He can get you in touch with the right people in your area and has a lot
of videos, tapes and books on UFOs and abductions. He is also a very
experienced researcher/investigator.
