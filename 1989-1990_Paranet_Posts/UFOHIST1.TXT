Early  1960's...Frank  Scully  dies.  (Author  of  "Behind  the  Flying 
Saucers".)                               
 
Aug.   13,  1960..Red Bluff,  CA:  CHP Officers Charles A.  Carson  and 
Stanley Scott were on patrol when they sighted what they thought was an 
airliner about to crash. When the UFO had descended to about 100 or 200 
feet  altitude  it suddenly reversed direction and climbed to 500   ft. 
Description: round or oblong surrounded by a glow (color not mentioned) 
and having definite red lights at each end. They continued to watch the 
UFO  as  it  performed "unbelievable"  aerial feats.  The  local  RADAR 
operator  confirmed  the UFO at this time but denied it the  next  day. 
Other  Tehema County Sheriffs'  officers also saw this UFO and  another 
similar one that same night. (NICAP, 1964)                        
                                                                      
May,  1961......In the May issue of "Fate" magazine,  Master Sgt.  O.D. 
Hill  admits that we are still loosing Air Force planes to  UFOs.   The 
first case was an F-86  jet fighter that was sent aloft to  investigate 
an  UFO  that had been plotted on the Radar scope of an Air Base  (name 
and  dates  classified).   The  Radar Operator spied  the  UFO  heading 
straight for the craft.  The operator radioed for the F-86  to climb at 
once, but it was too late.  The two blips merged as one and the UFO was 
tracked moving away.  Classified as "mysterious"  not a single shred of 
the F-86  was ever found. (ref. Kinross AFB where an F-89  with crew of 
two merged with an UFO and disappeared.-Donald Keyhoe)            
                                                                    
Second Case:  A  radar operator was tracking a transport plane carrying 
26  persons aboard when, suddenly,  another blip appeared on the screen 
closing  at 2500  mph on the transport.  Before the operator could warn 
the  transport  the two blips emerged as one.  The remaining blip  sped 
straight  up  at tremendous speed.  A  surface search in  the  vicinity 
revealed no oil slicks on the water, although a Generals' briefcase was 
found floating around. (see 4/1/59;9/29/59)                       
                                                                      
1961-1963......Near Nellis AFB, NE: "Mat", a radio maintenance engineer
at  Nevada's  AEC between 1961-1963,  provided evidence  to  the  MUFON
Journal  that  Project REDLIGHT was secretly being conducted at  nearby
"Area 51",  a  50-mile-square quadrant of land east of Nellis AFB. This
Project "involved flight-testing of an UFO which had been shipped there
from Edwards AFB."  The craft flew silently, was about 20 to 30 ft.  in
diam., and had no wings or tail.                                  
                                                                      
Apr.   ,1962.....Flight  Commander P.J.  (initials),  attached  to  TAC
Fighter Wing was deployed at Wright-Patterson AFB and mistakenly  broke
into an air hanger where he  thought the gym was located. Upon entering
the hanger he was approached by an air police sentry with a sub-machine
gun.  Behind the sentry was a saucer approx. 12-15 ft. diam.  suspended
off the  ground  by  two  engine test stands. There were no markings or
insignia on the saucer. It had no rivet markings. The saucer was roped-
off and 8 guards stood at parade rest around it.  P.J.  and his  friend
were encouraged to leave the hanger.  P.J. returned to MyrtleBeach AFB,
S.C.                                                              
                                                                      
July   17,   1963..A  passenger  of  a  Convair-880   related  to   UFO
investigator,   James Moseley,  that the 4 engined jet airliner she had
been flying in was pursued by an UFO.  The jet , traveling at 600  mph,
made  a  sharp  turn to avoid the UFO,  now rapidly closing in  on  the
plane.   Just as they were about to collide,  the UFO swerved  away  at
fantastic speed and  disappeared  in  the night sky. When the (unnamed)
woman  confronted the pilot about the incident,  he said,  "I  wouldn't
dare  risk telling the airline of the incident.  If I could tell you of
some of the experiences my buddies have had, you'd never fly again!" 
                                                                    
Apr.   15,   1964..USAF  Intelligence officer meets with  2  Aliens  at
prearranged  location  in  the desert of  New  Mexico.   Project  SIGMA
operates at AFB, New Mexico. (see 1959)                           
                                                                      
Oct.,  1964.....Air Force and Army radar stations tracked an UFO as  it
hovered  over  and flew along the demilitarized zone between North  and
South Korea. The UFO was visible for over an hour.                
                                                                      
Dec.  10, 1964..Fort Riley, KA: Recovery of Saucer by A.K.  (initials).
(see 11/00/65)                                                    
                                                                      
Dec. 19, 1964..MEMO to Chief, Contact Division: NICAP case #(censured):
Subject:   UFOs over Patuxent Navel Air Station between 1500  and  1530
hours. Two UFOs approached Air Base at 3800 mph. Another UFO approached
at 6000  mph.  Radar operator, Chief Pinkerton had visual on Radar.  US
Coast Guard had "visual"  on the UFOs. OFFICIAL statement to press: the
(single) blip was caused by faulty radar equipment! (see 1/25/65) 
                                                                    
Jan. 25, 1965..MEMO to Chief, Contact Division: NICAP Case #(censured).
(see 12/19/64)                                                    
                                                                    
1965...........While  visiting the Air Force Museum in Fairborn,  Ohio,
R.M.   (initials),  a  government employee of 23  yrs.,  went through a
double- door marked "Off Limits" and suddenly came face to face with an
Alien in a self contained space suite.  Description: About 4.5 ft. tall
with a translucent dome over its' large head;  wasn't human; large eyes
under  a heavy brow;  no noticeable nose;  a  slit for a mouth;  bluish
skin.  When the creature walked it didn't bend its' knees.  R.M.  later
found  out  from a retired Air Force Colonel from Wight-Patterson  AFB,
that 2 live Aliens were held in captivity in an artificial environment.
The  Colonel also said that a 2-man sized craft crashed near Whitewater
Lake,   Indiana,   as  a result of an  electrical  disturbance  in  the
atmosphere.   [The Alien would have to lock his knees in a high-gravity
environment to avoid falling down.]                               
                                                                      
Feb.  11,  1965..Personal Interview report by Capt.  D.M.   (initials):
Aerial  encounter of three UFOs with radar and visual  sightings.   Air
Force flight F-169  enroute from Anchorage,  AL, to Japan.  Capt.  R.W.
(initials)  and Capt. W. (initial) observed 3 UFOs on radar 5 miles off
the  wing.   The UFOs paced the Flying Tiger freighter aircraft for  30
minutes then climbed away at a steep angle at about 1200  knots  ground
speed. Estimated size (thumb and finger method) approx. 200 to 1000 ft.
diam.,  glowing red and oval shaped. The pilot remarked,  "we often see
UFOs on the Alaskan run!"                                         
                                                                      
May  28,   1965...Police  statement  (interview);   Bougainville  Reef,
Australia:  An Ansett-A.N.A.  DC-6B airliner (VH-INH)  en route to Port
Moresby,  New Guinea, was buzzed by a UFO at about 3:25 a.m.  The pilot
radioed  the  Townsville  Ground Control Tower and talked  to  Mr.   O.
(initial). Description: slightly spherical and oblate, flattened on top
and bottom;  appeared to have exhaust gasses coming from it.  Photos of
the UFO were taken by the pilot  but were later confiscated at Canberra
as was the taped conversation to Mr. O., the Tower operator. Mr. O. was
threatened with dismissal if he talked about the incident.        
                                                                      
July 3,  1965...Newspaper reports, ANTARCTICA:  Argentine,  British and
Chilean  military and scientific personnel observed an UFO moving at  a
frightening speed doing incredible maneuvers.  It was something  solid,
glowing  blue-green  and causing E/M interference with  our  equipment.
Lenticular  shaped "flying saucer".  Tracked by theodolite,  binoculars
and magnetograph tapes.  Also,  10  color photographs were taken of the
UFO.                                                              
                                                                      
Sept.  3, 1965..Project Blue Book File #(?): Damon/Angleton, TX. Deputy
Sheriffs Billy E.  McCoy and Robert W.  Goode were investigating an UFO
in  the back-woods roads when the purplish UFO shot  instantly  towards
them to within 150  feet and hovered at 100  feet off the ground.   The
bright  glow  illuminated the interior of the car and  the  surrounding
fields (11:30  p.m.).  "Every blade of grass stood out clearly"  in the
field. Officer Goode, who was driving with his arm out the window, felt
heat  on  his  arm and later reported that a cut that was  on  his  arm
healed more rapidly than normal [U/V effects].                    
                                                                    
Sept.16,1965...NICAP Report #(?): Pretoria, S. Africa:  Constables John
Lockem and Koos de Klerk while on patrol (after midnight)  suddenly had
a  domed,  disc shaped object come into their van headlights.   It  was
sitting on the road.  The UFO was copper colored and about 30  ft.   in
diam.   Immediately the UFO lifted off,  emitting tongues of flame from
two  tubes  or channels on the underside.  The flames  deflected  about
three  feet off the macadam road surface and were still  visible  after
loosing sight of the craft. Road damage: part of the road was caved-in,
and in a 6 foot area the gravel was separated from the tar.  Samples of
the  road  surface  were taken for analysis,  which  report  was  never
released.  Lt. Col. J.B.  Brits,  District Commandant of Pretoria North
said the incident was "highly SECRET ... and inquiry is being conducted
in TOP circles."                                                  
                                                                      
Nov., 1965.....Fort Riley, KA: "AK" (Aaron Kaback) was on guard duty at
2  a.m.  when the duty officer drove up and ordered him to hop into the
jeep.  He and 3 other officers were driven out to a remote area where a
large  oval objectwas resting.  An army chopper was hovering above  the
object and shining a bright light on it.  The object was approx.  35-48
ft.  in diam., had a fin on the end and an exhaust port or some kind of
hole below the fin.  It had rows of squares around the rim and remained
completely dead for the 2 1/2  hours they guarded it.  (Kaback seems to
be confused as to the actual date this incident occurred. see 12/10/64)
                                                                    
Mar.  20,  1966..Dexter, MI.: Frank Mannor, age 47,  and Ronald Mannor,
age  19,   went  out  at night through  swampy,   hummocky  terrain  to
investigate flashing lights in the swamp. They saw a domed,  elliptical
object with a quilted surface hovering about 8 ft.  off the ground in a
patch  of apparent mist.  The object glowed "blood red"  and  the  body
lights disappeared. They lost sight of the UFO and didn't see it again.
(see 3/21/66;4/1/66)                                              
                                                                      
Mar.  20, 1966..La Porte, IN: Patrolman Michael Spevak was on duty when
2   youths  pulled over and pointed out an UFO that they said had  been
following  them from Michigan City to La Porte.  According to the young
men,   the  object  frequently burst into such a bright glare  that  it
blinded them, forcing them off the highway.  It had been following them
at  an altitude of about 60  ft.  Both the young men and the  patrolman
noticed  a cross-shaped appendage protruding from the lower portion  of
the UFO.                                                          
                                                                      
Mar.   21,  1966..Law enforcement officer F.B.  (initials)  at  Dexter,
Michigan,  and officer "C" (initial)  on patrol sighted a landed saucer
in a swamp.  Description:  Large craft, like a pot;  no windows;  had a
dull  glow  and  steam was coming up from the water.   Sounded  like  a
turbine,   a   low  whine  or hum.  He  notified  Selfridge  AFB  which
immediately  sent out MP's,  well armed.  All law officers were ordered
back and their film was confiscated. Later his report and other reports
disappeared  from  police headquarters.  Then,  everyone in the  force,
including  he and "C",  were transferred to other parts of the  county.
The  UFO wasn't disabled.  F.B.  saw it take-off and climb straight up.
(see 3/1/67)                                                      
                                                                      
Apr.   1,   1966...From  LIFE  magazine:  In  a  hastily  called  press
conference,   the  USAF spokesman J.  Allen Hynek  suggested  that  the
Dextor,  MI,  UFO and others seen in the swamps near Hillsdale may have
been  marsh  (or  swamp)   gas that had  spontaneously  ignited.   (see
3/20/66;3/21/66)
