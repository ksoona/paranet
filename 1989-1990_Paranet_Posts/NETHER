- Economy
Overview: This highly developed and affluent economy is based on
private enterprise. The government makes its presence felt, however,
through many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare programs
affecting most aspects of economic activity. The trade and financial
services sector contributes over 50% of GDP. Industrial activity,
including construction, provides about 25% of GDP, and is led by the
food-processing, oil-refining, and metal-working industries. The highly
mechanized agricultural sector employs only 6% of the
labor force, but provides large surpluses for export and the domestic
food-processing industry. An unemployment rate of over 8.6% and a sizable
budget deficit are currently the most serious economic problems.
