For Immediate Release                          December 16, 1993     

                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                        AND ADMIRAL BOB INMAN 
            IN ANNOUNCEMENT OF ADMIRAL INMAN'S APPOINTMENT
                       AS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
     
                           The Rose Garden    
1:33 P.M. EST

                 THE PRESIDENT:  Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday I 
announced that Secretary Aspin would be stepping down as Secretary of 
Defense next month after a year of devoted service.  I want to stress 
again how deeply grateful I am on behalf of all Americans for his 
hard work and his many unique contributions to the Pentagon and to 
our national defense.
     
     To ensure the greatest possible continuity, I wanted to 
announced a successor as soon as possible.  So today, I am very 
pleased to announce my intent to nominate Admiral Bob Inman as the 
next Secretary of Defense.  
     
     Admiral Inman was one of our nation's highest-ranking 
and most respected military officers.  He was a four-star admiral 
whose career in the Navy and in our intelligence community and in 
private business has won him praise from both Democrats and 
Republicans who admire his intellect, his integrity and his 
leadership ability.
     
     The Admiral's experience in serving our nation is truly 
impressive.  He personally briefed Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy.  
He held senior positions under Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan and 
Bush.  Former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger called Admiral 
Inman "a national asset."  And I know he will be a national asset as 
Secretary of Defense.  
     
     He brings to this job the kind of character all 
Americans respect.  The son of a gas station owner in a small east 
Texas town, he rose to distinction and success on the basis of his 
brains, his talent, and his hard work.  He finished high school at 
15, graduated from college at 19, joined the Naval Reserve at 20, and 
then launched an impressive 31-year career in the Navy.  He served on 
an aircraft carrier, two cruisers and a destroyer, as well as on 
onshore assignments as an analyst for naval intelligence.  
     
     In 1976, at the age of 45, he became the youngest Vice 
Admiral in peacetime history.  Bob Inman's stellar intelligence work 
caught the attention of many military and civilian leaders and 
prompted his elevation to several high posts in the intelligence 
community.  He served as Vice Director of the Defense Intelligence 
Agency, Director of the National Security Agency, and Deputy Director 
of the Central Intelligence Agency.  Because of his outstanding 
service, he was awarded the National Security Medal by President 
Carter.
     
     Over the past decade since Admiral Inman left 
government, he served in a wide range of private sector positions, 
including CEO of two private sector electronics firms, Chairman of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and a teacher at his alma mater, 
the University of Texas.   He's also served on 11 non-for-profit 
corporate boards.  And in all these roles, Admiral Inman has 
established a reputation for penetrating analysis, strong leadership, 
and a rock-solid commitment to this nation's security.  Those 
qualities will serve our nation well as the Admiral becomes our next 
Secretary of Defense.
     
     This is a time of great change in our world.  We must 
build on the work Les Aspin began with a bottom-up review to ensure 
that we have the right forces and strategy for this new era.  We must 
ensure that, even as we reduce force levels, our military remains 
ready to fight and win on a moment's notice.  We must ensure that our 
men and women in uniform remain the best trained, the best equipped, 
the best prepared fighting force on Earth.  And we must maintain and 
build strong bipartisan support in the Congress and in the country 
for the foreign policy and national defense interests of our nation.
     
     I am confident that Admiral Inman is the right leader to 
meet these demanding challenges.  I am grateful that he's agreed to 
make the personal sacrifices necessary to return to full-time 
government service and to accept this important assignment at this 
pivotal time in world events.  I'm delighted that he will be joining 
our national security team, and I thank him for his service to the 
nation.
     
     ADMIRAL INMAN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  You do me 
great honor with this appointment.  Notwithstanding all the wonderful 
things you said, I am an imperfect human being who has been provided 
many wonderful opportunities, none quite yet of the status of this.  
I've not done all of them as well as I would like, but I've always 
worked hard at them, and I will work hard at this one.
     
     As you know, I did not seek the job.  In honesty, I did 
not want the job.  Ultimately, you would ask, then, why am I here?  
Duty and country.  I was persuaded from our lengthy conversations of 
the President's absolute commitment to build a strong bipartisan 
support for where this country needs to go in the years out ahead.  I 
would tell you up front, honestly, I did not vote for President 
Clinton, I voted for President Bush, even though I was mad at him 
about his handling of the economy, but because I considered him a 
personal friend.  The President did know that when he asked me to 
take this job. 
     
     I look forward to the challenges that are in front of 
us.  I particularly look forward to working with the senior members 
of the national security team.  Warren Christopher I consider an old 
friend and someone I enjoy working with, but I greatly admire.  Tony 
Lake is a new acquaintance to me, but in these very few short days, 
it's been a great start.
     
     But ultimately, the key to my being willing to do this, 
to give up a very happy and prosperous life, was the President's 
commitment and our interaction.  I had to be comfortable that he was 
persuaded I was the right choice for this time frame.  
     
     And, Mr. President, as you know, I had to reach a level 
of comfort that we could work together, that I would be very 
comfortable in your role as the Commander in Chief -- President --
while I was Secretary of Defense.  And I have found that level of 
comfort.
     
     As I look at the challenges in front of us the road 
ahead is already pretty well mapped.  I've had the privilege of 
knowing Les Aspin for more than 15 years.  He is truly one of the 
great intellects in this country.  From the first meeting, he's 
always been challenging what was the best approach to national 
security for this country.  I'm persuaded that the work he's done 
over these last 11 months will make it vastly easier for his 
successor, but it won't be an easy job.
     
     As I try to describe myself, I'm an operator, hopefully 
with a strategic view.  I would hope in the years ahead to focus on 
an area that may surprise you -- I've noted the media coverage this 
morning has focused almost entirely on my intelligence background.  
In these last 10 years I've learned a lot about how business works, 
and I would hope to spend a lot of my time on bringing best business 
practices to the Department of Defense.
     
     My sense in traveling the country is that the public is 
less concerned about what we're doing overseas or our commitments 
than whether we are getting a dollar value for a dollar spent in 
defense.  And I would hope at the end of our years working together, 
we will have persuaded them, Mr. President, that they are.  And I 
would hope to ensure that we practice standards of ethics and 
integrity in the Department of Defense that will be a beacon for the 
rest of government.
     
     Finally, to my many friends in the media, both here and 
around the country, there have been at my last count some 82 calls 
last night and this morning for interviews.  If we are going to build 
a bipartisan support for national security, it has to begin with 
establishing the best relationship with the Congress.  I will be 
deeply respectful of the Senate's approach to the confirmation 
process.  I believe, therefore, it will be wisest if I limit my 
public remarks on issues until the confirmation process is through, 
and then I will try to be as available to all of you in the future as 
I have been in the past.  
     
     Thank you very much.  And thank you, Mr. President, for 
your confidence.
                                 END1:41 P.M. EST

 Statement by the White House Press Secretary on Admiral Inman
     
     From 1986 to the present, Admiral Bob Inman and his wife 
employed a part-time housekeeper (on a 1-3 times a week basis) 
for whom they did not withhold social security and related taxes. 

     At the outset of his discussions with the White House, 
Admiral Inman fully disclosed this situation and made clear his 
intent to come into compliance with administration policy on this 
issue.

     Today Admiral Inman has filed the requisite forms with the
Internal Revenue Service and has made payment on approximately 
$6,000 in taxes owed. Any interest and penalties will be 
calculated and assessed directly by the Internal Revenue Service 
at a later date.

For Immediate Release                                 December 16, 1993

                  BIOGRAPHY OF BOBBY RAY INMAN

      During a 31-year military career that included some of the most
sensitive national security posts in government, Bobby Ray Inman earned
a bipartisan reputation as one of the nation's finest intelligence
officers.  News accounts have referred to him as "simply one of the
smartest people ever to come out of Washington or anywhere," (Omni,
11-84) and "a superstar in the intelligence community [and] a
tough-minded administrator" (Newsweek, 2-16-81).

      Inman was born in 1931 in the small town of Rhonesboro, Texas.
After graduating from high school at age 15 and the University of Texas
at age 19, he joined the Naval Reserve in 1951 and was commissioned an
ensign in 1952.  He then spent 19 years as an analyst for Naval
Intelligence, serving on an aircraft carrier, two cruisers and a
destroyer, as well as in a variety of onshore assignments.

      In 1972, Inman graduated from the Naval War College and became the
executive assistant to the vice chief of naval operations.  He then
rose to Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence of the Pacific Fleet
in 1973, Director of Naval Intelligence in 1974, and Vice Director of
the Defense Intelligence Agency in 1976.  He was named director of the
National Security Agency in 1977, and served four years at the head of
this major agency.  As he rose through these posts, Inman won the
Distinguished Service Medal, the Navy's highest non-combatant award,
and the DIA's Defense Superior Service Medal for "achievements
unparalleled in the history of intelligence."

      In 1981, Inman was nominated by President Reagan to be the Deputy
Director of Central Intelligence.  He was easily confirmed, and served
in that position until resigning in March 1982.  At that time, he
became the first naval intelligence specialist ever to earn the rank of
four-star Admiral.  Senator David Boren said of Inman's time at the CIA
that, "it was principally Admiral Inman who first showed that the
congressional oversight process could work."

      Since leaving the Navy, Inman has been involved in several
business ventures, served on a variety of corporate boards, and acted
as an outside advisor to three Presidents, the State Department, and
Congress.  Currently a resident of Austin, Texas, Inman is married to
the former Carolyn Russo.  They have two sons, Thomas and William.
