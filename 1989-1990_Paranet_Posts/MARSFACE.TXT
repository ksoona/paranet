            By Mike Malin, Principal Investigator of the Mars Face


For those of you not familiar with the
topic, several Viking images show
features on the surface of Mars that,
in the eyes of some people, resemble
"faces", "pyramids" and other such
"artifacts".  The most famous of these
is the "Face on Mars" and associated
features "The City", "The Fortress",
"The Cliff", "The Tholus" and "The D&M
Pyramid".   A fairly substantial
"cottage" industry has sprung up
around these features, with several
books having been written about them,
newsletters published, public
presentations, press conferences and
of course, National Enquirer and
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------






other "tabloid" published reports.

The basic premise of these people is
that the features are artificial and
are messages to us from alien beings.
Their tack is to say, "These should be
rephotographed by Mars Observer, since
with high resolution we should be able
to PROVE that these are artificial.
If these are in fact artificial, this
would rank as one of the greatest
discoveries in history and thus every
effort should be made to acquire
images".  Evidence cited as presently
"proving" these are unnatural
landforms include measurements of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
angles and distances that define
"precise" mathematical relationships.
One of the most popular is that "The
D&M Pyramid" is located at 40.868
degrees North Latitude, relative to
the control network established by
Merton Davies (the RAND scientist who
has been more or less singularly
responsible for establishing the
longitude/latitude grids on the
planets) to an accuracy (actually, a
precision) of order 0.017 degrees.

They point out that 40.868 equals
arctan (e/pi); alternatively, one of
the advocates notes that the ratio of
the surface area of a tetrahedron to
its circumscribing sphere is 2.72069
(e = 2.71828), which, if substituted
for e in the above arctan equation
gives 40.893 degrees, which is both
within the physical perimeter of the
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Pyramid" and within the above stated
precision.  Other mathematical
relationships abound.  The advocates
of this view argue that "no scientific
study of these features has been
conducted under NASA auspices" and
that NASA and the conservative science
community are conspiring to keep the
"real" story from the American public.

The conventional view is that this is
all nonsense.  The Cydonia region lies
on the boundary between ancient upland
topography and low-lying plains, with
the isolated hills representing
remnants of the uplands that once
covered the low-lying area.  The
features seen in these mesas and
buttes (to bring terrestrial
terminology from the desert southwest
to bear on the problem) result from
differential weathering and erosion of
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
layers within the rock materials.  The
area is of considerable importance to
geologists because it does provide
insight into the sub-surface of Mars,
and to its surface processes.  The
measurement of angles and distances
seems so much numerology, especially
when one understands the actual
limitations in the control network (of
order 5-10 km, or 0.1-0.2 degrees) and
the imprecision of our corrections of
the images (neglecting, for example,
topography when reprojecting data for
maps) on which people are trying to
measure precise angles and distances.

Even given accurate data, however,
most science does not depend solely on
planimetric measurements, even when
using photographs.  There are many
other attributes used to examine
features that don't work for these
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
things.  No one in the planetary
science community (at least to my
knowledge) would waste their time
doing "a scientific study" of the
nature advocated by the proponents of
the "Face on Mars is Artificial"
perspective.

To provide you with an idea of the
magnitude of this issue, consider that
I spend roughly a quarter of my time
these days trying to prepare
thoughtful answers to (often abusive)
letters from people who analyse every
word in every sentence in every
paragraph in every letter I have
written on the subject (they send
copies of my letters to each other and
excerpt them in their newsletters).
They see innuendo and hidden meaning
everywhere.  I also have it on first-
hand authority that at least 2 NASA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Headquarters managers spend similar
amounts of time responding to letters
sent over from Congressmen whose
constituents write about "The Face"
and to which NASA is obligated to
respond.

Before I discuss the observations MOC
will make of "The Face on Mars", some
facts about the camera and its ability
to look at specific locations are
needed.

0. The MOC is body fixed to the
spacecraft.  It has no independent
pointing capability.  It makes
pictures the same way a fax machine
does (i.e., the scene is moved past
the single line detector).

1. Cross-track Field of View - The MOC
has a very small field of view (0.44
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
degrees), which is about 3 km from the
400 km orbital altitude.  It typically
takes very small images at very high
resolution (lots of data).  Anything
wider than 3 km cannot be imaged in
its entirety.

2. Along-track Field of View - The
MOC's downtrack field of view is
limited by the amount of data that
will fit in its buffer (about 10 MB).
If one uses the entire buffer (which
is not likely to be completely empty
unless its planned to be) and 2:1
realtime predictive compression, this
translates to a downtrack image length
of about 15 km.  We've designed the
camera to be able to average pixels
together to synthesize poorer
resolution, which frees up data.
Under the best case buffer
availability, an 8X summed image would
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
be 3 km wide (but only 256 pixels
across) by 40960 pixels long which, at
12 m/pxl (8 X 1.5) would be almost 500
km long.

3. Pointing Control Instability - The
spacecraft uses IR horizon sensors for
in-orbit pointing control.  Owing to
variations in the IR flux of the
horizon with latitude, season, surface
topography, atmospheric dust content,
cloudiness and other meteorological
and climatological conditions, the
control capability is about 10 mrad
(0.6 degrees = 4 km), which is larger
than the MOC field of view.

4. Spacecraft Position Uncertainty -
The position of the spacecraft is
determined by radio tracking for 8
hours (roughly 4.5 hours of actually
seeing the spacecraft) a day, and by
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
computing the position of the Earth,
Mars, and the spacecraft in an
inertial coordinate system.  It takes
a few days to do this and to use it to
determine where the spacecraft will be
a few days later.  By that time,
gravity perturbations, atmospheric
drag, and autonomous momentum
unloadings will have changed the
orbit.  Error studies suggest that the
uncertainty seven days after the end
of a given orbit can be represented as
a 40 second uncertainty in the time
the spacecraft will be at a specific
point in its orbit.  This translates
(at the orbital rate of the spacecraft
projected on the ground of 3 km/s) to
120 km downtrack and (because Mars
rotates at 0.24 km/s at the equator)
9.6 km crosstrack.  At 40 degrees
latitude, the crosstrack uncertainty
is 7.4 km.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Non-inertial Position Uncertainty -
The position of the spacecraft is
determined inertially.  As noted
above, the position of the longitude/
latitude grid is also uncertain to
about 5-10 km.

6. Orbit Spacing - If, in spite of the
preceding, orbits were equally spaced,
then the average spacing of orbits at
the equator for the 687 day mission
would be about 2.5 km, which means
that each spot on the equator will
fall within the MOC field of view in
(possibly) two images.  In fact, the
repeat distance is just over 3.1 km,
again assuming equal spacing and it is
more than likely that each spot on
the equator will only be seen once. At
40 degrees latitude, the spacing is
roughly 2.4 km, and any location will
be seen, at most, twice.  Given Items
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-5, it is most likely that some
places will be overflown twice, and
others not at all and that our ability
to predict this is very limited.

We are attempting to address some of
these issues with, for example,
optical navigation.  This could reduce
the spacecraft position uncertainty by
perhaps a factor of five or more.  We
will try to create a new control grid
with higher precision (perhaps as good
as 1 km).  But we cannot do anything
about the orbit spacing or the
pointing control or the width of the
MOC field of view.  Thus, hitting
anything as small as a specific 3 km
piece of the planet is going to be
very difficult.

And what about the fact that Mars has
a very dynamic atmosphere?  The one
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
orbit we fly over something of
interest, it may be cloudy, or dusty.

Despite providing a number of people
involved with the "private" studies of
the "Face of Mars" with exactly the
same information I've just noted, they
continue to think I am purposefully
avoiding taking the picture they want.
They are very concerned that the MOC
is being run by a company and that I
will try to ransom or profit from the
"important" data (as if they are not).
And talk of conspiracy is everywhere.
But it isn't the case: if we get a
picture of "The Face," we will most
definitely release it.

"The Face on Mars", "The City", "The
Fortress", "The Cliff", "The Tholus",
"The D&M Pyramid", etc. are in our
target database (now they want
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
detailed copies of that binary data
base!).  We will try to get pictures
(its almost impossible not to try to
take the pictures, since the data base
and initial targeting effort is fully
automatic).  Of course, given the
factors noted above, I'd be stupid to
tell people we were definitely,
without doubt and postively without
uncertainty going to get a picture of
any of these things.  For one thing,
they would then cry that I was hiding
the picture if in fact we never got
one.  So my approach has been not to
promise anything, which of course gets
me in trouble, too.

We will try.  We more than likely will
not succeed.  There is no conspiracy.
We are not ignoring the problem (just
the people, who are making a real
nuisance of themselves).          end.
