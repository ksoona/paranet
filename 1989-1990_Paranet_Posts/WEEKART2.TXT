Other than an alien invasion, what might account for the abduction
phenomenon?  Skeptics note that these stories are contemporary
variations on age-old themes and scenarios.  "Abduction delusions
[abound] in folklore," says Robert Baker, a University of Kentucky
professor emeritus.  "Since the Middle Ages, people have been abducted
by dragons, ogres, leprechauns, fairies, and so on.  They're not
crazy; they're victims of what are commonly known as 'waking dreams,'
delusions you have when you're in a hypnopompic [waking up] or
hypnogogic [falling asleep] state."

Most abduction stories begin in bed, with the victim being awakened
by beings who magically slip into the bedroom, transport their
paralyzed victim through solid walls and seldom leave any signs of
their visit.  This bears a striking resemblance to the phenomenon of
sleep paralysis, a well-documented but poorly understood state in
which one is awake but still paralyzed by the neurological mechanism
that inhibits muscle tone during sleep.  "Almost 90 percent of the
time, sleep paralysis is accompanied by a certainty that there is
something threatening in the room with you," says David Hufford, the
author of the book "The Terror That Comes in the Night."

And there are other caveats.  Some researchers say that scenarios of
being held against one's will and physically violated suggest masked
memories of childhood abuse.  Nor does the fact that two people report
experiences stand as corroboration, according to critics.  "It's very
easy for two people to have the same kind of hallucinatory experience
at the same time, then reinforce each other," says the University of
Kentucky's Baker.  What's more, "it's been demonstrated that you can
hypnotize people who don't claim to have been abducted, tell them they
have had an abduction experience, and they'll report the same thing
that so-called real abductees report."

Yet even doubts are fascinated.  "I, myself, don't believe" in
abductions by aliens, says Laurence Goldstein, author of "The Flying
Machine and Modern Literature."  "But to say something is imaginary
is not to say it's unreal:  the imagination is a real faculty that can
penetrate to truth.  Flying saucers are ... authentic manifestations
of anxieties.  Therefore, we don't want to just dismiss the whole
controversy as ridiculous.  We want to ask why these things are going
on."

The first rash of UFO sightings in this country happened nearly a
century ago, and some observers see a similar case of millennial fever
in today's outbreak of abduction reports, "that sense of some
apocalyptic cycle in history impending and the fear of being taken
over by some powerful alien force."  Goldstein says, "Back then, it
culminated in H.G. Wells "War of the Worlds."  We have abductions, and
films like "Aliens."

Goldstein sees the "alien invasion" as a reflection of everything
from an us-vs.-them fear of illegal immigrants (aliens) to the loss
of privacy in the 1990s (the invasion of personal space).  But the
biggest theme, he says, is the end of one era--the Cold War--
coinciding with the start of a millennium. "That sense of some new
cycle about to begin is symbolized by a terror of the alien taking
over. ... Americans are ambivalent about the future, and that shows
up in UFOs."

Skye Ambrose, for one, insists that her experience is no metaphor. 
In contrast to the many abductees who feel trapped and frightened by
their encounters, she embraced and explored hers.  The results have
been dramatic, she says.  "It's like going through reincarnation, and
within that I'm not quite 4 years old."

Ambrose left her career in real estate sales and marketing and is not
a massage therapist.  She says she has replaced the fear, insecurity
and tension in her life with spiritual growth.  She's writing a book
about her abduction experiences, and learning more about the aliens'
grand designs for evolutionary mid-wifery.  "I know now that I chose
to go through this.  I'm cooperating with a universal purpose."



SIDEBAR:

ABDUCTED? AUTHOR SAYS NO

Former New York Times science editor Walter Sullivan outlines signs
of extraterrestrial life in a revised edition of his "We Are Not
Alone: The Continuing Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence"
(Dutton, $23), in stores this week.  In a Q&A with USA Weekends's
Richard Vega:

Q:  Do you believe in life on other planets?
A:  Of course, of course.

Q:  Have extraterrestrial beings ever visited Earth?
A:  There is a possibility, but not in recent times.

Q:  Will we ever have contact with alien creatures?
A:  Oh, absolutely.  That's the whole justification for the SETI
[Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program.  That's a big
program--something like $10 million a year is being put into that by
the [U.S.] government, the theory being that the distances are so
great that travel may be impractical.  But radio, of course, is far
cheaper.

Q:  Have people ever been taken aboard UFOs?
A:  I think it's imaginary.  People hallucinate and believe this sort
of thing.  It may be commercial in some cases; they want a good story
to sell.  But with most of them, I don't think that's true.  They
sincerely imagined this thing.

Q:  As long as you believe in extraterrestrial life, why not also
believe in the UFO abduction phenomenon?
A:  Suppose you were from another civilization, and you could do what
we cannot do, which is travel at the speed of light.  Your
civilization is probably 100 light years away.  That means it would
take you 100 years to come here.  You are not going to suddenly carry
off some girl and give her an experience and bring her back.  You are
going to manifest yourself in a more convincing way.



EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE:  A CALL-IN

As scientists debate life elsewhere in the universe, and UFO stories
make headlines, we want to know what you think (touch-tone telephone
users only):

1.  Do you believe intelligent beings exist elsewhere in the universe?

      YES, press 1                 NO, press 2

2.  Do you believe space aliens have visited Earth, now or in the
past?
