  Rich Boylan, who has only been on this echo for a very short time, entered 
with somewhat of a splash making some very blunt statements.  Seems that 
related to this subject, that can be an occupational hazard.  He is not a 
private UFO investigator who tends to stay away from the more public 
television sector like Bud Hopkins, but he jumps into the thick of things.
I can appreciate his need to do that, since he probably is carrying alot of 
very private emotions around due to his caseload.  This is not saying that he 
breaks patient confidentiality, which he is very good about.
  His personal experiences are what ultimately, IMHO triggered his anger.  He 
has had his tires shot out from under him by the Wackenhut Security Forces at 
Area 51.  He fully understands the motives, the goals, the methodologies and 
the private he..s that people are enduring in this juncture in human history.
  
  What needs to be fully understood here on this echo is that all jokes aside, 
this is extremely serious business (contrary to what the skeptics would like 
you to believe).
