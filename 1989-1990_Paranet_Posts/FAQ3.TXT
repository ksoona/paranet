=== UFO Projects & Theories & Controversies
--------------------------------------------


6.00: Aurora Project or "deep black" projects
----------------------------------------------
The "Black Projects" are governmental projects that are considered
technological secrets. These can range from laser and particle beams to
top secret aircraft. The "Aurora Project" is the name given to one of
these types of projects by the industry experts involving two new types
of reported aircraft. These aircraft where observed in the south west US
and are said to have been developed at highly classified government
facilities in the Nevada desert. There are two types of advanced aircraft
reported.

One is nick named the "Pulser" aircraft. There have been many sights of
this aircraft by several different  witnesses. When sighted it has
repetitively been described as "A high-speed aircraft characterized by a
very loud, deep, rumbling engine noise (1-2 Hz pulse rate) reminiscent of
heavy-lift rockets."  The smoke trail of the aircraft is described as
being segmented and in a linked sausage shape. (Or another good example
would be to look at one side of your coat zipper, un-zipped, with the
teeth facing you) It is also described as a high-altitude aircraft that
crossed the sky at extremely high speeds. Both ground based and airborne
observers have reported it to be seen flying at altitudes above 50,000
ft. observers have reported see the aircraft as a single bright light
that seldom changed direction, however speed changes where observed. One
observer estimated that it covered 350 miles in 6 minutes. (3500
miles/hr)


This this aircraft may indeed exist. There has been research in to what
are called Pulsed Detonation Engines (PED's) also refereed to as Pulsed
Detonation Wave Engines. These are different type of engine than the
pulse jet engines, which is already publicly know, and has been tested in
aircraft. The PED's are said to be in laboratory and computer analysis
level of development (reported oct of 91) The PED's exhaust emission
produces smoke trails that closely match the pulser aircraft. Simulations
of theses engines are said to be able to propel large aircraft in the
"Mach 0.2-3.0 flight regime"

How PED's work: PED's use shock waves created in a detonation to compress
the fuel-oxidizer mixture prior to combustion. A cylinder chamber
designed to support the detonation is constructed with a flat forward end
which makes up the thrust wall. Air along with fuel is fed into the
engine from behind the thrust-wall. The detonation wave created travels
forward to the thrust wall at about Mach 4 and compresses the fuel-air
mixture, promotes supersonic combustion and causes a pressure rise in the
engine. The wave then strikes the thrust wall and rebounds accelerating
the combustion products towards the nozzle. Some of the products are
ejected by the wave to the outside air-stream through the air inlet
openings creating a toroidal vortex out side the engine. Then the cycle
repeats.

The said advantages of this type of engine are: 
* Theoretically a higher fuel efficiency than a "constant pressure engine" 
* Engines can be produced in many sizes and thrust outputs from a few 
  inches in diameter at a thrust of several pounds to  larger one that can
  output in the thousands of pounds range. 
* They have high thrust to weight ratio (ie.lighter engine, more thrust) 
* They are mechanically simple, and have few moving parts. 
* They could operate in or out of the atmosphere using fuel oxidizers.


There is very little information on the other reported aircraft. It is
reported as "A triangular-shaped, quiet aircraft". This craft has been
seen by many observers and flying with several F-117 stealth aircraft.

6.02: NASA Footage September 10th
---------------------------------
Space Ice or an alien craft dodging a missile. That's the big debate on
the footage taken by an unmanned camera on the space shuttle. One side
says that it is space Ice accelerated by the space shuttles thrusters.
The other side says the excelleration of some the objects don't follow
the correct paths don't match physics. They speculate its a alien craft
dodging a Starwars missile.

6.03: Planetoid (Wormwood)
--------------------------
Beyond Pluto astronomers believe there is a ring of ice chunks circling
the solar system 37 to 59 A.U. from the sun. They have called the ice
belt the Kuiper belt. Beyond that astronomers say there is a similarly
composed Oort cloud which forms a sphere around our planetary system that
stretches two light years in distance. A tiny red spot of light was
recorded in hawaii in October of 92,  which is thought to be the first
component of the Kuiper belt ever observed. The object was named 1992 QB1.
It is about 200 km across and 5.1 billion km away from the sun (41.2
a.u.). The object is fairly red, suggesting a surface rich in organics.
The current position is, for 0h UT on September 15, 1992:  0h 00.09+0d
01'.7 (2000.0). It is moving retrograde at only 3" per hour. David Jewitt
and Jane Luu discovered it using the University of Hawaii's 2.2-meter
telescope on Mauna Kea.  They have been searching for such an object for
the last five years. The first images were secured August 30, but just as
with the discovery of Pluto in 1930 the discovery was kept "under wraps"
for awhile to allow a better assessment. Jewitt believes it to be one of
the larger members of the Kuiper belt. Jewitt says that it will take two
months to confirm the object.

Another theory involving the planetoid comes to us from channelers. It is
a hollowed out body that was moved here by the Reptoids, in order to
transport an army of Grays or Reptoids. [sorry, I'm not sure which, I
haven't had a chance to research this in-depth] It is now  parked outside
the orbit of Pluto.  It is currently being used as a base by the
Reptoids.

Then there is also the theory that the planetoid may be the star that is
mentioned in the Bible as "Wormwood" (also translated as "bitterness");
which when the "third angel" in the book of Revelation blew his trumpet,
fell to the earth and poisoned one third of the earths waters.  Another
interesting fact is that "chernobyl" (as in the Nuclear power plant in
"Russia" that had a meltdown) in Ukranian also means Wormwood.

6.04: Project Blue Book
-----------------------
On Sep 30 ,1947  Lt General Twining of ACM expressed his opinion that there
was sufficient substance in reports to warrant a study on UFOs. On Dec.
23,1947 Project Sign was established to collect, collate, evaluate, and
disseminate all information concerning UFO sightings and phenomena.
Project sign completed it evaluations in Feb of 1949 and concluded "No
definite and conclusive evidence is yet available that would prove or
disprove the existence of these UFOs as real aircraft of unknown and
unconventional configuration." Project Sign was changed to Project Grudge
on Dec.16, 1948. Project Grudge recommended that the investigation and
study of UFO reports be reduce in scope. In early 1950 UFO reports by the
public increased. This prompted Project Grudge to be changed to Project
Blue Book in march of 1952.
 
Project Blue Book goals were to find out: 
1: To find an explanation for all the reported sighting of UFO's. 
2: To determine if the UFO posed any security threat to the United States.
3: To determine if UFO's exhibit any advanced technology which the U.S.
   could Utilize.

When the project ended the Air Force concluded:
1: There is no evidence that any UFOs are "extraterrestrial vehicles"
2: No UFO has ever given any indication of a threat to the national
   security. 
3: There is no evidence that UFO's represent technological developments
   or principals beyond present-day scientific knowledge.

You can get the project Blue Book papers from Any Federal Repository which
has copies of National Archives material (there are various scattered
around the country). Or, you can go to the National Archives in
Washington, DC. They're on microfilm, like the Census records that
genealogists use.

[I will finish researching this later, I had to return the book before I
 was done. :-(]

6.05: Roswell Crash Incident
----------------------------
  The Roswell Incident started with sightings of UFOs on June 24, 1947. In
July 2,  of the sane year Mac Brazel heard a loud crash.  The next day he
went out Horseback riding with a neighbor and came upon a field with
debris scattered about.

 The debris field was 3/4 of a mile long and 300 feet wide. It was
oriented in a northwest to southeast direction.  There was a gouge in the
northwest side of the debris field that was 500 feet long and 10 feet
wide.  The debris on the field mostly consisted of I-beams and parchment
like, paper thin pieces of metal material. The material was very light in
weight, a dull gray in color, and most pieces were 6 to 7 inches in
length.  Some pieces that were even thinner that paper could not be
broken in half,  cut or burned.
  Mac Brazel collected several pieces of the debris and went back to his
ranch.  On July 6,  Brazel went into Roswell to report what he had seen
and to show a piece of the debris to sheriff Wilcox. The sheriff decided
to call the local air base. During this time Frank Joyce called in from
the local radio station to see if anything newsworthy was happening
around town. Brazel gave him the information about what he had found.
  Major Jesse A. Marcel and a few other military personal arrived from
the base only a few minutes after the sheriff had finished  talking to
the people at the base.  Brazel and the military personal left and went
back to the Ranch. The next morning (July 7) they went to the crash
sight. The military retrieved some of the debris and returned to Roswell.
  On July 8, the military came back and sealed off the area, They took
Brazel into custody.  That same day they found a second crash sight two
and 1/2 miles southeast of the first.  Barney Barnett and 4
archaeologists  had stumbled onto the new sight a few minutes before the
military had gotten there.  At the sight was found a "pretty good sized
metallic dull gray object" and 4 small alien bodies. They were 4 to 5
feet tall,  with large pair shaped heads, small bodies and skinny arms
and legs.  They had two large eyes,  no ears and no hair. Their skin was
pinkish grey and leathery.  They were wearing a one piece grey suits. The
civilians were escorted out of the area when the military arrived.

  On July 9th the military escorted Brazel to the radio station , there
he told Frank Joyce that he saw a weather balloon. He left again with the
military and didn't get back to his ranch until around July 15.  Later
when asked about what had happened Brazel said he had given a oath and
could not talk about it.
  The Incident remained closed and the public and  UFO research
organizations at large accepted the weather balloon story until 1970 when
Jesse A.  Marcel broke the silence and told his part in the story.

8.15: Revelations of Awareness
------------------------------
"Revelations of Awareness" published by Cosmic Awareness Communications
(CAC).

Revelations of Awareness is a Newsletter that covers UFO as they relate
to channeling and the New Age movement.  All the information given in the
newsletter is information recorded from channeling sessions. The format
of of the news letter begins with a question asked of the Cosmic
Awareness, then replies are given by the Awareness through the rest of
the news letter starting out with the phrase "This Awareness indicates..."

The following Statement appears at the top of every Issue:

Cosmic Awareness is the force that expressed Itself through Jesus of
Nazareth, the Buddha, Krishna, Mohammed, Edgar Cayce and other great
avatars who served as 'Channels' for the 'Heavenly Father' and who speaks
again today as the world begins to enter the 'New Age' of spiritual
consciousness and awareness. Since 1963 Cosmic Awareness has been
communicating through carefully trained channels. This information is for
those who desire to help in bringing in the new age. Throughout the
thousands of 'Readings' given through these various channels, Cosmic
Awareness tells us not to believe anything, but to question, explore,
doubt, and discover for yourself, through your own channel what is the
truth. Cosmic Awareness will only 'indicate' and 'suggest'. Neither C.A.C
or any of the Interpreters is responsible for anything Cosmic Awareness
states in any of these readings, nor does C.A.C. or the Interpreters
necessarily agree with the statements of Cosmic Awareness. The
interpreters interpret the energies as they see them in trance levels and
are not personally responsible for what is said. This is entirely the
responsibility of the editor. Members of C.A.C. are invited to send in
questions of general interest to ask Awareness for possible publication
in this newsletter.
