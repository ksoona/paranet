 
                     ARE SPACE MEN MUTILATING COWS?


                         From the Cullman Times

Are aliens mutilating cattle in Cullman County?

An  Associated  Press  news  item stated there have been reports of slaughtered
animals  in  Cullman  and Marshall counties, work thought to be that of satanic
cults.

But  Jeff  Ballard of Arab, state director of the Mutual UFO Network, said some
recent  cattle  mutilations  in  Alabama  appear to have been done with lasers,
leading to the possibility of "non-human perpetrators".

"It's  always  kind  of a pat answer to say that a satanic cult is responsible"
for such acts, he said.  MUFON has been investigating reports of a beheaded cow
in Chilton County.

Ballard  said there have been mysterious cattle mutilations in 30 states and in
many of them there have been sightings of UFOs.
