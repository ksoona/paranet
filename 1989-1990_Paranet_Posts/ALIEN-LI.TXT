Because Bill is unable, for the time being, to post messages on
Paranet (other than netmail) I am relaying Bill's book review.
Thank you for your effort Bill.

ALIEN UPDATE Edited by Timothy Good, is described by the publisher
(Arrow, UK, 1993) as the sequel to "Alien Liaison".  While it continues the
themes an issues taken up in the latter (particularly the controversial "Cosmic
Journey" of Bob Oechsler), in style it is a continuation of the UK series
published by Sidgwick & Jackson, namely "The UFO Report" for 1990, 1991 and
1992.  These 3 titles were edited by Timothy Good.  "Alien Update" is
essentially "The UFO Report 1993".  As in the previous titles in this annual
series, the quality of the contributions varies with the experience and
background of the contributor. Briefly the contributions are as follows:

1. "Is there an alien base in Puerto Rico?" by Jorge Martin. Martin continues
his intriguing reports on spectacular activity in Puerto Rico that were
featured in the 1991 and 1992 volumes.  For the US audience, at least the 1990
volume appeared in the US as "UFO Report" in 1991 by Avon. I presume the others
have and/or will appear.  Any reader of FSR will realise that Puerto Rico has
been a focus of strange activity for a long time. Martin's reports in the 90s
continues the work of Sebastion Robiou Lamarche in the 70s. Something is
certainly going on!

2. "Speak Plainly, and go political" by Hal McKenzie, basically a
"call to arms", "mann the barricades" for the cause of truth, justice & the
American way.  Gives "Operation Right to Know" a plug. Basically get out there
and petition!

3. & 4. George Wingfield weighs in with 2 contributions - his own UFO sighting
("UFOs over Washington, DC, April, 1992") and more of the same (as per previous
wild eyed "crop circle" reports) in his updates on the 1992 "circles" scene
("Circular Conundrums of 1992"). Wingfield is an ardent believer preaching to
the "believers".  In the face of the esculating decline in the legitimacy of
the crop circle "mystery" I wonder how long George can argue about dark
conspiracies and coverups he percieves as permeating what is essentially a 3
ring circus.  He throws out a "life ring" in the form of the strengthening "UFO
connection" contained in the work of Dr. Greer's shaky CE5 activities.  I think
this "connection" owes more to wishful thinking, uncritical thinking and sloppy
or absent investigations.  The quality of the alleged "UFO connection" still
leaves a lot to be desired. See by brief comments in my chapter on "Physical
Traces" (pg. 195) in Evans & Spencer, "UFOs 1947 - 1987" (1987) and for that
matter in "Controversy of the Circles" (BUFORA, 1989), pgs. 108 -109.  For a
while there I really thought "crop circles" might actually tell us something
interesting re the UFO landing "physical trace" phenomena, but alas I seem to
have been mistaken.

5.  Paul Dong offers as the chinese perspective with his "The Yin and Yang of
UFOs" - not to everyone's taste, but check it out.

6. The International flavour is filled out with Gheorghita Florin's "Close
Encounters in Romania" (1990 activity) and Nickolai Lebedev's continuing
reports ex the old USSR ("Important Developments in the former Soviet Union").
There is some interesting material amongst this but when some marginal evidence
of UFO activity near a nuclear power station in the old USSR draw the following
comment from Lebedev you have to wonder just how critical some of the
investigation is: "Are the ufonaunts only observing our potentially dangerous
nuclear power stations, or are they trying to prevent further tragic accidents?
We can only speculate, but I have to say that I believe in the likelihood of
both hypotheses."

7. Linda Howe offers her "1992 Animal Mutilations update"
on the ongoing "mute" saga.  Some of the "mutes" are particularly obscure in
terms of there relevance to the UFO phenomena.  Also I need to add that with
our extensive herds of cattle and huge flocks of sheep spread out over isolated
terrain, where or where is the Australian "mute" phenomenon, if indeed the
"mutes" are an integral part of the scene. The spartan "evidence" Linda Howe
has presented for an Australian connection is at best very poor.  I'll be the
first to check it out if something comes along of a compelling nature.

8. John Spencer presents a plea for a more "witness orienated" research
approach as described in more detail in his book "Perspectives".

9. Dr. Richard Haines and Bernard Guenette present easily the best
researched piece in "A large stationary object above Montreal", being an
account in a massive UFO seen on 7 November, 1990.  Despite the detail I was
still left wondering if there was a prosaic explanation for the affair.

10. Dr. Samuel Greco describes "The Williamsport Wave"
being a study of triangular and good old boomerangs over Pennsylvania on 6
February 1992.  Honest is wasn't us from down under!

11- Dr. James Deardorff provides us with a "Possible Extraterrestrial
Strategy for Earth", which is essentially is a reasonable rendering of a
scenario anchored in the premise of contact having occurred. While the style of
presentation does not seem unreasonable, it is perhaps what editor Tim Good
doesn't tell us about Dr. Deardorff that is relevant to know, in terms of what
he is trying to subtly direct us to. Deardorff put together "Celestial
Teachings" which is described as the companion volume to the "Talmud of
Jmmanuel" (!). I've seen this advertised and I'm afraid I won't be rushing out
to get a copy.  Bob Girard "reviewed" it in his Arcturus Catalogue.  He
describes "Celestial Teachings" as "an embarrassment, in which Billy Meier's
recording of a mysterious Aramaic scripture - complete with Christ as a
Pleiadian - is fanatically forced to fit a former fundamentalist's deep need to
reconcile UFOs and Christ."  The "Talmud" is  referred to as "The orginal
heretical testament of Jesus" which alleges "the true alien origin of
Christianity"! It is a pity that Tim Good doesn't feel it is appropriate to
tell his readership about this sort of relevant background information about
Dr. Deardorff.

12 - Bob Oechsler attempts to respond to the critics of his "Cosmic Journey".
Instead of adding credibility to his claims it gives more insight into his
rather woolly thinking processes. I'm afraid poor old Bobby Inman is damned if
he does, and dammed if he doesn't. Oechsler says he is in the know and hell he
must be right.  I reckon if I thrust my business card onto a complete stranger
who had remarkable intelligence connections asking him to help him get closer
to MJ-12, then almost a year later I engage the same person in esoteric
conversation in a unannounced "fishing expedition" never once mentioning the
word UFOs, I think I would rather like a little bit more explicit evidence that
the said same person actually understood the thrust of my conversation.  Like
much of his "sinister connections" in the "Chesapeake Connection" incredible
"confirmatory statements" are manufactured out of incredibly ambigious
material. If Mr. Oechsler seriously believes his incredible claims, surely by
the simpliest applications of scientific method one is being reasonable to ask
"where is the extraordinary evidence." Unfortunately there are many
extraordinary claims, but all too few bits of extraordinary evidence. The book
also includes a cross section of sighting reports which vary greatly in
quality. "Alien Update" is a interesting read, but the contributions vary in
content and quality.
