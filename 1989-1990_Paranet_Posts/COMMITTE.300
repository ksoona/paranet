                          FOREWARD



   In my career as a professional  intelligence officer, I had
many occasions to access highly classified documents, but dur-
ing service as a political science officer in the field in Angola,
West Africa, I had the opportunity to view a series of top secret
classified documents which were unusually explicit. What I saw
filled me with anger and resentment and launched me on a
course from which I have not deviated, namely to uncover what
power it is that controls and manages the British and United
States governments.
   I was thoroughly familiar with all of the well known secret
societies such as the Royal Institute for International Affairs
(RIIA), the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the Bilder-
bergers, Trilaterals, the  Zionists, Freemasonry, Bolshevism-
Rosicrucianism and all of the spinoffs of these secret societies.
As an  intelligence officer, and even before that as a young
student in the course of my studies at the British Museum in
London, I had cut my eye teeth on all of them, plus a good
number of others with whom I imagined Americans were familiar.
   But when I came to the United States in 1969, I found that
names like the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, Club of Rome
the German Marshall Fund, the Cini Foundation, the Round
Table, the Fabianists, the Venetian Black Nobility, the Mont
Pelerin Society, Hellfire Clubs, and many others were at best
totally unknown here, or else their true functions were at best
but poorly understood, if at all.

                               i

    In 1969-1970 set about remedying the situation in a series
of monographs and cassette tapes. Much to my surprise I soon
found plenty of people willing to quote these names as if they
had known of them all of their writing careers, but who were not
in  the  least bit knowledgeable about the subjects,  yet quite
unwilling to state the source of their lately acquired informa-
tion. I consoled myself with the thought that imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery.
   I pursued my  investigations,  pressing  on  in  the  face of
severe risks, attacks on myself and my wife, financial losses,
continual harassment, threats and calumny, all part of a care-
fully-crafted and orchestrated program to discredit me, run by
government agents and informers, embedded in the so-called
Christian  rightwing,  the  "Identity  Movement"  and rightwing
"patriotic"  groups.  These  agents  operated, and  still operate,
under cover of strong  and fearless outspoken opposition to
Judaism their main enemy, they would have us believe. These
agent-informers are led and controlled by a group of homosexu-
als who are well-liked and well-respected by political and reli-
gious conservatives all across the United States.
   Their program of calumny, lies and hatred, disinformation
about my work, even lately attributing it to other writers, contin-
ues unabated but it has not had the desired effect. I shall carry on
with my task until I have finally ripped off the mask of the entire
secret upper-level parallel government that runs Britain and the
U.S. This book is a part of that ongoing effort.

            AN OVERVIEW AND SOME CASE HISTORIES

   Certainly a fair number of us are aware that the people
running our government are not the people who are really in
control of political and economic matters, domestic and foreign.
This has led many to seek the truth in the alternative press, those
newsletter writers who, like me, have sought, but not always
found what it is that is making the United States terminally ill.
"Seek and ye shall find" has not always been the case with this
group.  What we did find was that the people walk in great
darkness, mostly not caring or bothering to find out where their
country is headed, firm in the belief that it will always be there
for them. This is the way the largest population group has been
manipulated to react, and their attitude plays right into the hands
of the secret government.
   We frequently hear about  "they " doing this, that or the other.
"They"  seem  literally  to  be  able  to  get  away  with  murder.
"They" increase taxes, send our sons and daughters to die in
wars that do not benefit our country. "They" seem above our
reach,  out of sight, frustratingly  nebulous  when  it comes  to
taking  action  against  "them."  No  one  seems  able  to  clearly
identify who "they" are. It is a situation that has pertained for
decades. During the course of this book, we shall identify the
mysterious "they" and then, after that, it is up to the people to
remedy their situation.
   On 30th April  1981, I wrote a monograph disclosing the
existence of the Club of Rome identifying it as a Committee of

                                1

3OO subversive body. This was the first mention of both of these
organizations in the United States. I warned readers not to be
fooled by the feeling that the article was far-fetched and I drew a
parallel  between my  article  and  the  warning  issued by  the
Bavarian government when the secret plans of the Illuminati fell
into its hands. We shall return to the Club of Rome and the role
of the Committee of 300 in U.S. affairs later herein.
   Many of the predictions made in that 1981 article have since
come to pass, such as the unknown Felipe Gonzalez becoming
prime minister of Spain, and Mitterand being returned to power
in  France;  the  downfall  of Giscard D'  Estang  and Helmut
Schmidt, the return to power of Swedish nobleman and Com-
mittee of 300 member Olaf Palme, the nullifying of Reagan's
presidency and the destruction of our steel, auto and housing
industries  in terms  of the  post-industrial zero-growth order
handed down by the Committee of 300.
   The importance of Palme lies in the use made of him by the
Club of Rome to deliver technology to the Soviet Union on the
forbidden  list of the U.S. Customs,  and Palme's  world-wide
communications network employed to train the spotlight on the
phony  Iran  hostage  crisis,  while  he  shuttled back and forth
between Washington and Teheran in an effort to undermine the
sovereign integrity of the U.S. and place the phony crisis in the
realm of a Committee of 300 institution, viz, the World Court at
The Hague, Holland.
   In what is in fact an open conspiracy against God and man,
which includes enslaving the majority of humans left on this
earth after wars, plagues and mass-murder have done with them
is not well hidden. In the intelligence community, it is taught
that the best way to hide something is to place it in open view.
As an example of the foregoing, when Germany wanted to hide
its prize new Messerschmidt fighter plane in 1938, the aircraft
was put on display at the Paris Air Show. While secret agents
and spies were collecting information from hollow tree trunks
and from behind loose bricks in a wall, the information they

                                2

sought was staring them right in the face.
   The upper-level parallel secret government does not operate
from dank basements and secret underground chambers. It places
itself in full view in the White House, Congress and in Number
10 Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament. It is akin to
those weird and supposedly terrifying "monster" films, where
the monster appears with distorted features, long hair and even
longer teeth, growling and slavering all over the place. This is
distraction, the REAL MONSTERS wear business suits and
drive to work on Capitol Hill in limousines.
   These men are IN OPEN VIEW. These men are the servants
of the  One World Government-New World  Order.  Like  the
rapist who stops to offer his victim a friendly ride, he does not
LOOK like the monster he is. If he did, his intended victim
would run off screaming in fright. The same applies to govern-
ment at all levels. President Bush does not LOOK like a dutiful
servant of the upper-level parallel government, but make no
mistake about it, he is  as much a MONSTER  as  are those
horrors found in horror-movies.
   Stop for a moment and consider how President Bush ordered
the brutal slaying of 150,000 Iraqi troops, in a convoy of military
vehicles carrying white flags, on their way back to Iraq under
Geneva Convention rules of agreed disengagement and with-
drawal. Imagine the horror of the Iraqi troops when, in spite of
waving their white flags, they were mowed down by American
aircraft. In another part of the front, 12,000 Iraqi soldiers were
buried alive in trenches they occupied. Is that not MONSTROUS
in the truest sense of the word? From where did President Bush
get his orders to act in this MONSTROUS fashion? He got them
from the Royal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA) who
received its mandate from the Committee of 300, also known as
the "Olympians."
    As we shall see, even the "Olympians" do not hide their
faces. Often times they put on a show which could be likened to
the Paris Air Show, even as conspiracy buffs spend their time in

                                3

fruitless searching in the wrong places and in the wrong direc-
tion. Note how the Queen, Elizabeth II, performs the ceremonial
opening of the British Parliament? There, in full view is the
head of the Committee of 300. Have you ever witnessed the
swearing-in ceremony of a United States President? There in
full view is another member of the Committee of 300. The
problem is only one of perception.
   Who are the conspirators who serve the mighty all-powerful
Committee  of 300? The better-informed of our citizens are
aware that there is a conspiracy and that the conspiracy goes
under various names such as the Illuminati, Freemasonry, the
Round Table,  the Milner Group.  To them the CFR and the
Trilaterals represent most of what they do not like in regard to
domestic and foreign policy. Some even know that the Round
Table  has a big input into United States affairs through the
British ambassador in Washington. The problem is that real hard
information  on  the treasonous  activities of members of the
invisible Government is very hard to come by.
   I quote the profound statement made by the prophet Hosea,
which is found in the Christian Bible: "My people perish for lack
of knowledge." Some may already have heard my expose of the
foreign aid scandal, in which work I named several conspirato-
rial organizations, whose number is legion. Their final objective
was the overthrow of the U.S. Constitution and the merging of this
country, chosen by God as HIS country, with a godless One
World-New World Order Government which will return the
world to conditions far worse than existed in the Dark Ages.
   Let us talk about actual case histories, the attempt to com-
munize and deindustrialize Italy. The Committee of 300 long
ago decreed that there shall be a smaller--much smaller--and
better world, that is, their idea of what constitutes a better world.
the myriads  of useless  eaters  consuming  scarce  natural re-
sources were to be culled. Industrial progress supports popula-
tion growth. Therefore the command to multiply and subdue the
earth found in Genesis had to be subverted.

                                4

   This called for an attack upon Christianity; the slow but sure
disintegration of industrial nation states; the destruction of hun-
dreds of millions of people, referred to by the Committee of 300
as "surplus population," and the removal of any leader who
dared to stand in the way of the Committee's global planning to
reach the foregoing objectives.
   Two of the Committee's earliest targets were Italy and Paki-
stan. The late Aldo Moro,  Prime Minister of Italy,  was  one
leader who opposed "zero growth" and population reductions
planned for his country, thereby incurring the wrath of the Club
of Rome commissioned by the "Olympians" to carry out its
policies in this regard. In a Rome courtroom on November 1Oth,
1982, a close friend of Moro's testified that the former prime
minister was threatened by an agent of the Royal Institute for
International Affairs (RIIA)   who is also a Committee of 300
member   while he was still the U.S. Secretary of State. The
meteoric rise of the man the witness named as Kissinger will be
dealt with later.
   It will be recalled that Prime Minister Moro was kidnaped by
the Red Brigades in 1978 and subsequently brutally shot to death.
It was at the trial of members of the Red Brigades that several of
them testified  to  the fact that they  knew  of high-level  U.S.
involvement in the plot to kill Moro. When threatening Moro,
Kissinger was obviously not carrying out U.S. foreign policy, but
rather acting according to instructions received from the Club of
Rome, the foreign-policy arm of the Committee of 3OO.
   The witness who delivered the bombshell in open court was
a close associate of Moro's, Gorrado Guerzoni. His explosive
testimony was broadcast over Italian television  and radio on
November lOth, 1982, and printed in several Italian newspa-
pers yet this vital information was  suppressed  in  the  U.S.
Those famous bastions of freedom with a compelling right to
know, the Washington Post and the New York Times, did not
think it important to even print a single line  of Guerzoni's
testimony.

                                5

   Nor was the news carried by any of the wire services or
television stations. The fact that Italy's Aldo Moro had been a
leading politician for decades, and who was kidnaped in broad
daylight in the spring of 1978, all of his bodyguards butchered
in  cold  blood,  was  not  deemed  newsworthy,  even  though
Kissinger stood accused as an accomplice to these crimes? Or
was the silence BECAUSE of Kissinger's involvement?
   In my  1982 expose of this heinous crime, I demonstrated
that Aldo Moro, a loyal member of the Christian Democrat
Party, was murdered by assassins controlled by P2 Masonry
with the object of bringing Italy into line with Club of Rome
orders to deindustrialize the country and considerably reduce its
population. Moro's plans to stabilize Italy through full employ-
ment and industrial and political peace would have strengthened
Catholic opposition to Communism and made the destabilization
of the Middle East--a prime goal--that much harder.
   From the foregoing it becomes clear just how far ahead the
conspirators plan. They do not think in terms of a Five Year
Plan. One needs to go back to Weishaupt's statements about the
early Catholic Church to understand what was involved in the
murder of Aldo Moro. Moro's death removed the roadblocks to
the plans  to destabilize Italy,  and as  we now know, enabled
conspiracy plans for the Middle East to be carried out in the
Gulf War 14 years later.
    Italy was chosen as a test-target by the Committee of 300.
Italy is important to the conspirators'  plans because it is the
closest European country to the Middle East linked to Middle
East economics and politics. It is also the home of the Catholic
Church,  which Weishaupt ordered destroyed,  and home for
some of Europe's most powerful top oligarchical families of the
ancient Black Nobility. Should Italy have been weakened by
Moro's death, it would have had repercussions in the Middle
East which would have weakened U.S. influence in the region.
Italy is important for another reason; it is a gateway for drugs
entering Europe from Iran and Lebanon, and we shall return to

                                6                              

that subject in due course.
   Various groups had combined under the name of socialism
to bring about the downfall of several Italian governments since
the Club of Rome was established in 1968. Among these are the
Black Nobility of Venice and Genoa, P2 Masonry and the Red
Brigades, all working for the same goals. Police investigators in
Rome working on the Red Brigades-Aldo Moro case came
across  the  names  of several  very prominent Italian  families
working closely with this terrorist group. The police also dis-
covered evidence that in at least a dozen cases, these powerful
and prominent families had allowed their homes and/or property
to be used as safe houses for Red Brigades cells.
   America's "nobility" were doing their share to destroy the
Republic  of Italy,  a  notable  contribution  having  come from
Richard Gardner even while in his official capacity as President
Carter's ambassador to Rome. At that time Gardner was operat-
ing under the direct control of Bettino Craxi,  an  important
member of the Club of Rome and a key man in NATO. Craxi
was the leading edge of the conspirators' attempts to destroy the
Italian Republic. As we shall see, Craxi was almost successful
in ruining Italy, and as the conspirators hierarchy's  leading
player, was able to get divorce and abortion pushed through the
Italian Parliament, resulting in the most far-reaching and de-
structive religious and social changes ever to strike at the Catholic
Church, and consequently, the morals of the Italian nation.
   After President Ronald Reagan was elected, an important
meeting was held in Washington D.C. in December 1980 under
the auspices of the Club of Rome and the Socialist International.
Both these organizations are directly responsible to the Com-
mittee of 300. The main agenda was to formulate ways and
means of how to neutralize the Reagan presidency. A group plan
was adopted and, as we look back, it is perfectly clear that the
plan the conspirators agreed to follow has been very successful.
   In order to get an idea of how vast and how all-pervasive is
this conspiracy, it would be appropriate at this point to name the

                                7

goals set by the Committee of 300 for the pending conquest and
control  of the  world.  There  are  at  least 40  known  "branch
offices" of the Committee of 300, and we shall be listing them
all, together with a description of their functions. Once this is
studied it becomes easy to understand how one central con-
spiratorial body is able to operate so successfully and why it is
that no power on earth can withstand their onslaught against the
very  foundations  of a civilized, progressive  world,  based on
freedom of the  individual,  especially  as  it is declared in the
United States Constitution.
   Thanks to the sworn testimony of Guerzoni, Italy and Eu-
rope  but not the U.S. learned that Kissinger was behind the
death of Aldo Moro. This tragic affair demonstrates the ability of
the Committee of 300 to impose its will upon any government
without exception. Secure in his position as a member of the
most powerful secret society in the world, and I am not talking
about Freemasonry, Kissinger not only terrified Moro, but carried
through on his threats to "eliminate" Moro if he did not give up
his plan to bring economic and industrial progress to Italy.
   In June and July of 1982, the wife of Aldo Moro testified in
open court that her husband's murder came about as a result of
serious threats against his life, made by what she called "a high
ranking  United  States  political  figure."  Mrs.  Eleanora  Moro
repeated the precise phrase reportedly used by Kissinger in the
sworn testimony of Guerzoni: "Either you stop your political
line  or you  will pay  dearly for it." Recalled by  the judge,
Guerzoni was asked if he could identify the person Mrs. Moro
was talking about. Guerzoni replied that it was indeed Henry
Kissinger as he had previously intimated.
   Guerzoni went on to explain to the court that Kissinger had
made his threats in Moro's hotel room during the Italian leaders
official visit to the U.S. Moro--then Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister of Italy, a NATO member-country--was a man of high
rank, one who should never have been subjected to Mafia-like
pressures and threats. Moro was accompanied on his American

                                8

visit by the President of Italy in his official capacity. Kissinger
was then, and still is, an important agent in the service of the
Royal Institute for International Affairs, a member of the Club
of Rome and the Council on Foreign Relations.
    Kissinger's role in destabilizing the United States by means
of three wars, the Middle East,  Korea and  Vietnam,  is  well
known, as is his role in the Gulf War, in which the U.S. Army
acted as  mercenaries  for the Committee of 300 in bringing
Kuwait back under its control and at the same time making an
example out of Iraq so that other small nations would not be
tempted to work out their own destiny.
   Kissinger also threatened the late Ali Bhutto, President of
the sovereign nation of Pakistan. Bhutto's "crime" was that he
favored nuclear weapons for his country. As a Moslem state,
Pakistan felt threatened by continued Israeli aggression in the
Middle East. Bhutto was judicially murdered in  1979 by the
Council  on  Foreign  Relations  representative  in  the  country
General Zia ul Haq.
   In his planned ascent to power, ul Haq encouraged a frenzied
mob to set fire to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad in an apparent
attempt to show the CFR that he was his own man and to secure
more foreign aid and, it was later learned, to murder Richard
Helms. Several years later, ul Haq paid with his life for interven-
ing in the war raging in Afghanistan. His C-130 Hercules aircraft
was hit by an E.L.F. (electricallow frequency) shot shortly after
it took off, causing the aircraft to loop into the ground.
   The Club of Rome, acting on Committee of 300 orders to
eliminate General ul Haq, had no compunction in sacrificing the
lives  of a  number of U.S.  servicemen  on board  the  flight,
including a U.S. Army Defense Intelligence Agency group headed
by Brigadier General Herber Wassom. General ul Haq had been
warned by the Turkish Secret Service not to travel by plane, as
he was targeted for a mid-air bombing. With this in mind, ul Haq
took the United States team with him as "an insurance policy,"
as he commented to his inner circle advisors.

                                9

   In my 1989 work "Terror' in the Skies," I gave the following
account of what happened: "Shortly before ul Haq's C-130 took
off from a Pakistan military base,  a suspicious looking truck
was seen close to the hangar that had housed the C-130. The
control tower warned base security, but by the time action was
taken, the C-130 was already airborne and the truck had gone. A
few minutes later the plane began looping-the-loop until it hit
the ground and exploded in a ball of fire. There is no explanation
for such behavior by the C-130, an aircraft with a marvelously
reliable record, and a joint Pakistani-United States board of
enquiry Found no pilot error or mechanical or structural failure.
Looping-the-loop is a recognized trade mark of an aircraft hit by
E.L.F. fire.
   That the Soviet Union has been able to develop high-peak
radio frequency devices is known to the West through the work
of Soviet scientists who work in the Kurchatov Atomic Energy
Institute's Intensive Relatavistic Electron Beam Division. Two
of its specialists were Y. A. Vinograov and A. A. Rukhadze.
Both scientists worked in the Lededev Physics Institute, which
specializes in electronic and X ray lasers.
    After receiving this information, I searched for confirmation
from other sources and found that in England the International
journal of Electronics had published some material which ap-
peared to confirm the information given to me about the method
chosen to shoot down General ul Haq's C-130. In addition, the
information was confirmed by two of my intelligence sources. I
received some useful information from a Soviet scientific paper
on these subjects, published in England under the title "Soviet
Radio Electronics and Communications Systems." There was
no doubt in my mind that General ul Haq had been murdered.
The truck seen near the C-130 hanger undoubtedly carried a
mobile E.L.F. device of the type the Soviet Armed Forces are
known to possess.
   According to written testimony by Bhutto, smuggled out of
the country while he was in prison, Kissinger severely threatened

                               10

him: "I will make a horrible example if you continue with your
nation-building policies." Bhutto had fallen afoul of Kissinger
and the Club of Rome by calling for a nuclear energy program to
bring Pakistan into a modern industrialized state which, in the
eyes of the Committee of 300, was a direct contravention of its
orders delivered by Kissinger to the Pakistani government. What
Kissinger was doing when he threatened Bhutto was not official
U.S. policy, but the policy of the modern-day Illuminati.
   One needs to have a clear understanding of just why it is that
nuclear power is so hated all over the world, and why the fake
"environmentalist" movement, established and financially sup-
ported by the Club of Rome, was called upon to wage war on
nuclear energy. With nuclear energy generating electricity in
cheap  and  abundant  supplies,  Third World  countries  would
gradually become independent of U.S. foreign aid and begin to
assert their sovereignty. Nuclear generated electricity is  THE
key to bringing Third World countries out of their backward
state, a state which the Committee of 300 has ordered to remain
in position.
   Less foreign aid means less control of a country's natural
resources by the I.M.F. It was this idea of developing nations
taking charge of their destiny that was an anathema to the Club
of Rome and its ruling Committee of 300. We have seen oppo-
sition to nuclear power in the United States successfully used to
block industrial  development  in  conformity  with  the  Club's
"Post-Industrial Zero-Growth" plans.
   Dependence upon U.S. foreign aid actually keeps foreign
countries in servitude to the Council on Foreign Relations. The
people of the recipient countries receive very little of the money
as it usually ends up in the pockets of government leaders who
allow the natural raw material assets of the country to be savagely
stripped by the I.M.F. Mugabe of Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia,
is a good example of how raw material assets, in this case high
grade chrome ore, is controlled through foreign aid. LONRHO,
the giant conglomerate run by Angus Ogilvie, an important

                               11
                   
member of the Committee of 300,  on behalf of his cousin,
Queen Elizabeth II, now has total control of this valuable resource
while the people of the country sink ever deeper into poverty
and misery, notwithstanding a hand-out of in excess of $300
million from the United States.
   LONRHO now has a monopoly of Rhodesian chrome and
charges any price it likes, whereas, under the Smith government
this was not allowed. A reasonable price level was maintained
for twenty-five years prior to the Mugabe regime taking power.
While there were problems during the 14-year rule of Ian Smith,
since his departure unemployment has quadrupled and Zimbabwe
is in a state of chaos and de facto bankruptcy. Mugabe received
enough foreign aid from the U.S. (in the region of $300 million
per annum) to enable him to build three hotels on the French
Cote d'Azur, Cap Ferat and Monte Carlo, while his citizens
grapple with disease, unemployment and malnutrition, not to
mention an iron-fisted dictatorship that allows no complaints.
Contrast this with the Smith government which never asked for
nor received one red cent in aid from the United States. Thus it
is  clear that foreign aid is  a powerful means of exercising
control of countries such as Zimbabwe and indeed all African
countries.
    It also keeps U.S. citizens in a state of involuntary servitude
and therefore less able to mount meaningful opposition to gov-
ernment. David Rockefeller knew what he was doing when his
foreign aid bill became law in 1946. It has, since then, become
one of the most hated laws on the statute books following public
exposure of what it is a racket run by government and paid for
by we, the people.
   How can the conspirators maintain their grip upon the world,
and more especially, their chokehold over the U.S. and Britain?
One of the most asked questions is, "How can any single entity
know at all times what is going on and how is control exercised?"
This book will attempt to answer these and other questions. The
only way we can come to grips with the reality of the conspirator's

                               12

success is by mentioning and discussing the secret societies,
front  organizations,  government  agencies,  banks,  insurance
companies, international businesses, the petroleum industry and
the hundreds of thousands of entities and foundations whose
leading lights make up the membership of the Committee of
300--the ULTIMATE controlling body that runs the world and
has done so for at least a hundred years.
   Since there already are scores of books on the Council on
Foreign Relations (CFR) and the Trilaterals, we shall go directly
to the Club of Rome and the German Marshall Fund. When I
introduced these organizations to the United States, few, if any,
had heard of them. My first work, "The Club of Rome," published
in 1983 attracted almost no attention. Many uninitiated people
thought the Club of Rome was something to do with the Catholic
Church  and that the German Marshall Fund referred to the
Marshal Plan.
   This is precisely why the Committee chose these names, to
confuse and to deflect attention away from what was happening.
Not that the U.S. government didn't know, but as it was part of
the conspiracy, it helped to keep the lid on information rather
than let the truth be known. A few years after I published my
work,  a few writers  saw in it a wealth of hitherto untapped
information and began writing and talking about it as though
they had always had full knowledge of it.
   It came as a revelation to them that the Club of Rome and its
financiers under the title of the German Marshall Fund were two
highly-organized conspiratorial bodies operating under cover of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and that the
majority of Club of Rome executives were drawn from NATO.
The Club of Rome formulated all of what NATO claimed as its
policies and, through the activities of Committee of 300 member
Lord Carrington, was able to split NATO into two factions, a
political (left wing) power group and its former military alliance.
   The Club of Rome is still one of the most important foreign
policy  arms  of the Committee of 300--the other being the

                               13

Bilderbergers. It was put together in 1968 from hard-core mem-
bers of the original Morgenthau group on the basis of a telephone
call made by the late Aurellio Peccei for a new and urgent drive
to speed up the plans of the One World Government--now
called the New World Order, although I prefer the former name.
It  is  certainly  a better job-description  than the New World
Order, which is somewhat confusing as there have been several
"New World Orders" before, but no One World Government.
   Peccei's call was answered by the most subversive "future
planners" drawn from the United States, France, Sweden, Brit-
ain, Switzerland and Japan that could be mustered. During the
period 1968-1972, The Club of Rome became a cohesive entity
of new-science scientists, globalists, future planners and inter-
nationalists of every stripe. As one delegate put it, "We became
Joseph's Coat of Many Colors." Peccei's book "Human Qual-
ity" formed the basis of the doctrine adopted by NATO's political
wing.
   The following is extracted from Dr. Peccei's book, "Human
Quality":

    "For the first time  since the first millennium was ap-
   proached in Christendom, large masses of people are
   really in suspense about the impending advent of some-
   thing unknown which could change their collective fate
   entirely.... Man does not know how to be a truly modern
    man.... Man invented the story of the Bad Dragon, but if
   ever there was a bad dragon, IT IS MAN HIMSELF....
   Here we have the human paradox: man trapped by his
    extraordinary capacity and achievements, as in a quick-
   sand--the more he uses his power the more he needs it.

    "We must never tire of repeating how foolish it is to
    equate the present profound pathological state and mal-
    adjustment of the entire human system to any cyclic
    crisis or passing circumstances. Since man has opened

                               14

   Pandora's  Box  of new technologies,  he has  suffered
   uncontrolled human proliferation, the mania for growth,
   energy  crises,  actual  or  potential  resource  scarcities,
   degradation of environment, nuclear folly and a host of
   related afflictions."

   This is identical to the program adopted by the much later
fake "environmentalist" movement spawned by the same Club
of Rome to blunt and turn back industrial development.
   Broadly,  the  anticipated  counter-program of the  Club of
Rome would cover inventing and disseminating "post industri-
alization" ideas in the United States, coupled with the spread of
counterculture movements such as drugs, rock, sex, hedonism,
Satanism, witchcraft and "environmentalism." Tavistock Institute,
Stanford Research Institute and the Institute for Social Relations,
in fact the entire wide spectrum of research organizations in
applied social psychiatry either had delegates on the board of
the Club of Rome, or acted as advisors and played a guiding role
in NATO's attempt to adopt the "Aquarian Conspiracy."
   The name, New World Order, is seen as something devel-
oped as a consequence of the Gulf War in 1991, whereas the
One World Government is recognized as being centuries old.
The  New World Order  is  not new,  it has  been  around  and
developing under one or another guise for a very long time but it
is perceived as a DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUTURE, which
is not the case; the New World Order is PAST AND PRESENT.
That is why I said earlier that the term One World Government
is, or ought to be, preferred. Aurellio Peccei once confided in his
close friend Alexander Haig that he felt like "Adam Weishaupt
reincarnated." Peccei had much of Weishaupt's brilliant ability
to organize and control the Illuminati of today, and it showed
through in Peccei's control of NATO and formulating its policies
on a global scale.
   Peccei headed the Atlantic Institute's Economic Council for
three  decades while he was the Chief Executive Officer for

                               15


Giovanni Agnellis' Fiat Motor Company. Agnelli, a member of
an ancient Italian Black Nobility family of the same name, is
one of the most important members of the Committee of 300.
He played a leading role in development projects in the Soviet
Union.
   The Club of Rome is a conspiratorial umbrella organization,
a marriage between Anglo-American financiers and the old
Black Nobility families of Europe, particularly the so-called
"nobility" of London, Venice and Genoa. The key to the suc-
cessful control of the world is their ability to create and manage
savage  economic  recessions  and eventual depressions.  The
Committee of 300 looks to social convulsions on a global scale,
followed by depressions, as a softening-up technique for bigger
things to come, as its principal method of creating masses of
people all over the world who will become its "welfare" recipients
of the future.
   The committee appears to base much of its important deci-
sions affecting mankind on the philosophy of Polish aristocrat,
Felix Dzerzinski, who regarded mankind as being slightly above
the level of cattle. As a close friend of British intelligence agent
Sydney Reilly (Reilly was actually Dzerzinski's controller dur-
ing the Bolshevik Revolution's formative years), he often con-
fided in Reilly during his drinking bouts. Dzerzinski was, of
course, the beast who ran the Red Terror apparatus. He once told
Reilly, while the two were on a drinking binge, that "Man is of
no importance. Look at what happens when you starve him. He
begins to eat his dead companions to stay alive. Man is only
interested in his own survival. That is all that counts. All the
Spinoza stuff is a lot of rubbish."
   The Club of Rome has its own private intelligence agency
and also "borrows" from David Rockefeller's INTERPOL. Ev-
ery U.S. intelligence agency cooperates very closely with it, as
does the KGB and the Mossad. The only agency that remained
beyond its reach was the East-German intelligence service. the
STASSY. The Club of Rome also has its own highly organized

                               16

political and economic agencies. It was they who told President
Reagan to retain the services of Paul Volcker, yet another im-
portant Committee of 300 member. Volcker stayed on as Federal
Reserve Board chairman, notwithstanding the faithful promise
of candidate Reagan that he would dismiss him as soon as he,
Reagan, was elected.
   The Club of Rome, after playing a key role in the Cuban
Missile Crisis,  attempted to sell its  "crisis management" (the
forerunner of FEMA) program to President Kennedy. Several
Tavistock scientists went to see the President to explain what it
meant, but the President rejected the advice they gave. The same
year that Kennedy was murdered, Tavistock was back in Wash-
ington to talk with NASA. This time the talks were successful.
Tavistock was given a contract by NASA to evaluate the effect
of its coming space program on American public opinion.
   The contract was farmed to the Stanford Research Institute
and the Rand Corporation. Much of the material produced by
Tavistock, Stanford and Rand never saw the light of day and
remains sealed until now. Several Senate oversight committees
and sub-committees I approached to obtain information told me
they had "never heard of it," nor did they have the slightest idea
where I might find what I was seeking. Such is the power and
prestige of the Committee of 300.
   In  1966 I was advised by my intelligence colleagues to
approach Dr. Anatol Rappaport who had written a treatise in
which the administration was said to be interested.  It was a
paper intended to bring an end to NASA's space program, which
Rapport said had outlived its usefulness. Rappaport was quite
happy to give me a copy of his paper which, without going into
fine detail, basically claimed that NASA's space program should
be scrapped. NASA has too many scientists who were exerting a
bad influence on America because they were always eager to
lecture schools and university audiences on how rocketry worked,
from construction to propulsion. Rappaport claimed that this
would produce a  generation of adults  who would decide to

                               17

become space scientists, only to find themselves "redundant" as
no one would need their services by the year 2000.
   No sooner had Rappaport's profiling report on NASA been
presented to NATO by the Club of Rome, than the Committee of
300 demanded action. NATO-Club of Rome officials charged
with urgent anti-NASA action were Harland Cleveland, Joseph
Slater,  Claiborne  K.  Pell,  Walter J.  Levy,  George  McGhee,
William Watts, Robert Strausz-Hupe (U.S. ambassador to NATO)
and Donald Lesh. In May 1967 a meeting was organized by the
Scientific and Technological Committee of the North Atlantic
Assembly  and the Foreign Policy Research Institute.  It was
called "Conference on Transatlantic Imbalance and Collabora-
tion" and it was held at Queen Elizabeth's palatial property in
Deauville, France.
   The basic purpose and intent of the conference at Deauville
was to end U.S. technological and industrial progress. Out of the
conference came two books, one of which is mentioned herein,
Brzezinski's  "Technotronic  Era."  The  other  was  written  by
conference  chairman,  Aurellio  Peccei,  entitled  "The  Chasm
Ahead." Peccei largely agreed with Brzezinski, but added that
there world be chaos in a future world NOT RULED BY A
ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT. In this regard, Peccei insisted
that the  Soviet Union must be offered "a convergence  with
NATO," such a convergence ending in an equal partnership in a
New World Order with the United States. Both nations would be
responsible for future "crisis management and global planning."
The first Club of Rome's "global planning contract" went to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), one of the premier
Committee of 300's research institutes. Jay Forrestor and Den-
nis Meadows were placed in charge of the project.
   What was their report all about? It did not differ fundamen-
tally from what Malthus and Von Hayek preached, namely the
old question of not enough natural resources to go around. The
Forrestor-Meadows Report was a complete fraud. What it did
not say was that man's proven inventive genius would in all

                               18

likelihood work its way around "shortages." Fusion energy, the
DEADLY enemy of the Committee of 300, could be applied to
CREATING natural resources. A fusion torch could produce
from one square mile of ordinary rock enough aluminum, for
example, to fill our needs for 4 years.
   Peccei never tired of preaching against the nation-state an
how destructive they are for the progress of mankind. He called
for  "collective responsibility."  Nationalism was a cancer on
man was the theme of several important speeches delivered by
Peccei. His close friend Ervin Lazlo produced a work in 1977 in
a similar vein which was called "Goals of Mankind," a landmark
study for the Club of Rome. The entire position paper was a
vitriolic  attack  on  industrial  expansion  and  urban  growth.
Throughout these years,  Kissinger,  as the designated contact
man, kept in close touch with Moscow on behalf of the RIIA.
"Global modeling" papers were regularly shared with Kissinger's
friends in the Kremlin.
   With regard to the Third World, the Club of Rome's Harland
Cleveland prepared a report which was the height of cynicism.
At the time, Cleveland was United States Ambassador to NATO.
Essentially, the paper said it would be up to Third World nations
to  decide  among  themselves  which  populations  should  be
eliminated. As Peccei later wrote (based on the Cleveland Re-
port): "Damaged by conflicting policies of three major countries
and  blocs,  roughly patched  up  here  and there,  the  existing
international  economic  order  is  visibly  coming apart at the
seams....The prospect of the necessity of the recourse to triage--
deciding who must be saved--is a very grim one indeed. But, if
lamentably, events should come to such a pass, the right to make
such decisions cannot be left to just a few nations because it
would lend themselves to ominous power over life of the world's
hungry."
   In this is found the committee policy of deliberately starving
African nations to death, as evidenced in the sub-Sahara na-
tions. This was cynicism at its worst, because the Committee of

                               19

300 had already abrogated the decisions of life and death unto
itself, and Peccei knew it. He had previously so indicated in his
book "Limits of Growth." Peccei completely dismissed industrial
and agricultural progress  and in its place demanded that the
world come under one coordinating council, to whit, the Club of
Rome and its NATO institutions, in a One World Government.
    Natural  resources  would  have  to  be  allocated  under the
auspices of global planning. Nation states could either accept
Club of Rome domination or else survive by the law of the
jungle and fight to survive. In its first "test case," Meadows and
Forrestor planned the 1973 Arab-Israeli War on behalf of the
RIIA to sharply bring home to the world that natural resources
like petroleum would in the future come under global planners
control, meaning of course, under the control of the Committee
of 300.
    Tavistock Institute called for a consultation with Peccei to
which McGeorge Bundy, Homer Perlmutter and Dr. Alexander
King were invited. From London Peccei traveled to the White
House where he met with the President and his cabinet, Followed
by a visit to the State Department where he conferred with the
Secretary of State, the State Department's intelligence service
and State's Policy Planning Council. Thus, from the very be-
ginning, the United States government was fully aware of the
Committee of 300's plans for this country. That should answer
the often asked question, "Why would our government allow
the Club of Rome to operate in a subversive manner in the
United States?"
   Volcker's economic and monetary policies were a reflection
of those of Sir Geoffrey Howe, Chancellor of the exchequer and
member of the Committee of 300. This serves to illustrate how
Britain has controlled the United States, beginning from soon
after the War of 1812, and continues to exercise control over this
country through the policies of the Committee of 300.

----Committee of 300 - Part 2 ----------------------------------------


   What are the goals of the secret elite group, the inheritors of
Illuminism (Moriah Conquering Wind), the Cult of Dionysius,

                               20

the Cult of Isis, Catharism, Bogomilism? This elite group that
also calls itself the OLYMPIANS (they truly believe they are
equal in power and stature to the legendary gods of Olympus,
who have, like Lucifer their god, set themselves above our true
God) absolutely believe they have been charged with imple-
menting the following by divine right:
   (1) A One World Government-New World Order with a
       unified church and monetary system under their direc-
       tion. Not many people are aware that the One World
       Government began setting up its "church" in the 1920's/
       1930's, for they realized the need for a religious belief
       inherent in mankind to have an outlet and, therefore,
       set up a "church" body to channel that belief in the
       direction they desired.
   (2) The utter destruction of all national identity and national
       pride.
   (3) The destruction of religion  and more especially the
       Christian religion, with the one exception,  their own
       creation mentioned above.
   (4) Control of each and every person through means of
       mind control and what Brzezinski call "technotronics"
       which would create human-like robots and a system of
       terror beside which Felix Dzerzinski's Red Terror will
       look like children at play.
   (5) An end to all industrialization and the production of
       nuclear generated electric power in what they call "the
       post-industrial zero-growth society." Exempted are the
       computer and service industries. United States indus-
       tries that remain will be exported to countries such as
       Mexico  where  abundant  slave  labor  is  available.
       Unemployables in the wake of industrial destruction
       will either become opium-heroin and or cocaine addicts,
       or become statistics in the elimination process we know
       today as Global 2000.
   (6) Legalization of drugs and pornography.

                                21


(7) Depopulation of large cities according to the trial run
    carried out by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. It is
    interesting to note that Pol Pot's genocidal plans were
    drawn up here in the United States by one of the Club
    of Rome's research foundations. It is also interesting
    that the Committee is presently seeking to reinstate the
    Pol Pot butchers in Cambodia.
(8) Suppression of all scientific development except for
    those deemed beneficial by the Committee. Especially
    targeted is nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Par-
    ticularly hated are the fusion experiments presently
    being scorned and ridiculed by the Committee and its
    jackals of the press. Development of the fusion torch
    would blow the Committee's conception of "limited
    natural resources" right out of the window. A fusion
    torch properly used could create unlimited untappeed
    natural resources from the most ordinary substances.
    Fusion torch uses are legion and would benefit mankind
    in a manner which is as yet not even remotely com-
    prehended by the public.
(9) Cause by means of limited wars in the advanced coun-
    tries, and by means of starvation and diseases in Third
    World countries, the death of 3 billion people by the
    year  2000,  people  they  call  "useless  eaters." The
    Committee of 300 commissioned Cyrus Vance to write
    a paper on this subject of how best to bring about such
    genocide. The paper was produced under the title the
    "Global 2000 Report" and was accepted and approved
    for action by President Carter, for and on behalf of the
    U.S. Government, and accepted by Edwin Muskie,
    then Secretary of State. Under the terms of the Global
    2000 Report, the population of the United States is to
    be reduced by 100 million by the year 2050.
(10)To weaken the moral fiber of the nation and to demor-
    alize workers in the labor class by creating mass unem-

                               22

     ployment. As jobs dwindle due to the post industrial
     zero growth policies introduced by the Club of Rome,
     demoralized and discouraged workers  will resort to
     alcohol and drugs. The youth of the land will be en-
     couraged by means of rock music and drugs to rebel
     against the status quo, thus undermining and eventually
     destroying the family unit. In this regard The Commit-
     tee of 300 commissioned Tavistock Institute to prepare
     a blueprint as to how this could be achieved. Tavistock
     directed Stanford Research to undertake the work under
     the direction of Professor Willis Harmon. This work
     later became known as  "The Aquarian Conspiracy."
(11) To keep people everywhere from deciding their own
     destinies by means of one created crisis after another
     and then "managing" such crises. This will confuse and
     demoralize the population to the extent where faced
     with too many choices, apathy on a massive scale will
     result. In the case of the United States, an agency for
     crisis management is already in place. It is called the
     Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA),
     whose existence I first disclosed in 1980. There will be
     more on FEMA as we proceed.
(12) To introduce new cults and continue to boost those
     already  functioning  which  includes  rock  "music"
     gangsters such as the filthy, degenerate Mick Jagger's
     "Rolling Stones" (a gangster group much favored by
     European  Black Nobility)  and all of the  Tavistock-
     created "rock" groups which began with "The Beatles."
     To continue to build up the cult of Christian funda-
     mentalism begun by the British East India Company's
     servant, Darby, which will be misused to strengthen the
     Zionist state of Israel through identifying with the Jews
     through the myth of "God's Chosen People" and by
     donating very substantial amounts of money to what
     they mistakenly believe is a religious cause in the

                              23

     furtherance of Christianity.
(14) To press for the spread of religious cults such as the
     Moslem  Brotherhood,  Moslem fundamentalism,  the
     Sikhs, and to carry out experiments of the Jim Jones
     and "Son of Sam" type of murders. It is worth noting
     that the late Ayatollah Khomeini was a creation of
     British Intelligence Military Intelligence Division 6,
     commonly known as M16, as I reported in my 1985
     work, "What Really Happened In Iran."
(15) To export "religious liberation" ideas around the world
     so  as  to  undermine all existing religions but more
     especially the Christian religion. This began with "Je-
     suit Liberation  Theology"  which brought about the
     downfall of the Somoza family rule in Nicaragua and
     which is today destroying EI Salvador, now 25 years
     into a "civil war," Costa Rica and Honduras. One very
     active entity engaged in so-called liberation theology is
     the Communist oriented Mary Knoll Mission.  This
     accounts for the extensive media attention to the mur-
     der of four of Mary Knoll's so-called nuns in EI Salva-
     dor a few years ago.
       The four nuns were Communist subversive agents
     and their activities  were widely documented by  the
     government of EI Salvador. The United States press
     and news media refused to give any space or coverage
     to the mass of documentation in possession of the
     Salvadorian government, documentation which proves
     what the Mary Knoll Mission nuns were doing in the
     country. Mary Knoll is in service in many countries,
     and played a leading role in bringing Communism to
     Rhodesia, Mozambique, Angola and South Africa.
(16) To cause a total collapse of the world's economies and
     engender total political chaos.
(17) To take control of all Foreign and domestic policies of
     the United States.

                              24

(18) To give the fullest support to supranational institutions
     such  as  the  United  Nations  (UN),  the  International
     Monetary  Fund (IMF),  the  Bank of International
     Settlements (BIS), the World Court and, as far as pos-
     sible, make local institutions of lesser effect by gradu-
     ally phasing them out or bringing them under the mantle
     of the United Nations.
(19) Penetrate and subvert all governments, and work from
     within them to destroy the sovereign integrity of nations
     represented by them.
(20) Organize a world-wide terrorist apparatus and negoti-
     ate  with terrorists whenever terrorist activities take
     place. It will be recalled that it was Bettino Craxi who
     persuaded the Italian and U.S. governments to negoti-
     ate with the Red Brigades kidnapers of Prime Minister
     Moro and General Dozier. As an aside, General Dozier
     is under orders not to talk about what happened to him.
     Should he break that silence, he will no doubt be made
     "a  horrible  example  of" in  the  manner in  which
     Kissinger dealt with Aldo Moro, Ali Bhutto and Gen-
     eral Zia ul Haq.
(21) Take control of education in America with the intent
     and purpose of utterly and completely destroying it.
    Much of these goals, which I first enumerated in 1969, have
since been achieved or are well on their way to being achieved.
Of special interest in the Committee of 300 program is the core
of their economic policy, which is largely based on the teach-
ings of Malthus, the son of an English country parson who was
pushed to prominence by the British East India Company upon
which the Committee of 300 is modeled.
    Malthus maintained that man's progress is tied to the earth's
natural ability to support a given number of people,  beyond
which point earth's limited resources would rapidly be depleted.
Once these natural resources have been consumed, it will be
impossible  to replace  them.  Hence, Malthus  observed, it is

                              25

necessary to limit populations within the boundaries of decreas-
ing natural resources. It goes without saying that the elite will
not allow themselves to be threatened by a burgeoning popula-
tion of "useless eaters," hence culling must be practiced. As I
have previously stated, "culling" is going on today, using the
methods mandated in the "Global 2000 Report."
   All economic plans of the Committee meet at the crossroads
of Malthus and Frederick Von Hayek, another doom and gloom
economist who is sponsored by the Club of Rome. The Austrian
born  Von  Hayek has  long been under the control of David
Rockefeller, and Von Hayek theories are fairly widely accepted
in the United States. According to Von Hayek, the United States
economic platform must be based on (a) Urban Black Markets
(b) Small Hong Kong-type industries utilizing sweat-shop labor
(c) The Tourist Trade, (d) Free Enterprise Zones where specula-
tors can operate unhindered and where the drug trade can flourish
(e) End of all industrial activity and (f) Close down all nuclear
energy plants.
   Von Hayek's ideas dove-tail perfectly with those of the Club
of Rome,  which is perhaps why he is so well promoted in
rightwing circles in this country. The mantle of Von Hayek is
being passed to a new, younger economist, Jeoffrey Sachs, who
was sent to Poland to take up where Von Hayek left off. It will
he recalled that the Club of Rome organized the Polish eco-
nomic crisis which led to political destabilization of the country.
The exact same economic planning, if one dare call it that, will
be forced upon Russia, but if widespread opposition is encoun-
tered, the old price-support system will quickly be restored.
   The Committee of 300 ordered the Club of Rome to use
Polish nationalism as a tool to destroy the Catholic Church and
pave the way for Russian troops to reoccupy the country. The
"Solidarity"  movement was  a creation of the Committee of
300's Zbigniew Brzezinski, who chose the name for the "trade
union" and selected its office holders and organizers. Solidarity
is no "labor" movement, although Gdansk shipyard workers

                              26

were used to launch it, but rather, it was a high-profile POLIT-
CAL organization, created to bring forced changes in prepara-
tion for the advent of the One World Government.
    Most of Solidarity's leaders were descendants of Bolshevik
Jews from Odessa and were not noted for hating Communism.
This helps to understand the saturation coverage provided by
the American news media. Professor Sachs has taken the pro-
cess  a step further,  ensuring economic  slavery for a Poland
recently freed from the domination of the USSR. Poland will
now become the economic slave of the United States. All that
has happened is that the master has changed.
   Brzezinski is the author of a book that should have been read
by  every  American interested in the future  of this  country.
Entitled "The Technotronic Era," it was commissioned by the
Club of Rome.  The book is an open announcement of the
manner and methods to be used to control the United States in
the future. It also gave notice of cloning and "robotoids," i.e.
people who acted like people and who seemed to be people, but
who were not. Brzezinski, speaking for the Committee of 300
said the United States was moving "into an era unlike any of its
predecessors; we were moving toward a technotronic era that
could easily become a dictatorship." I reported fully on "the
Technotronic Era" in 1981 and mentioned it in my newsletters a
number of times.
    Brzezinski went on to say that our society "is now in an
information revolution based on amusement focus,  spectator
spectacles (saturation coverage by television of sporting events)
which provide an opiate for an increasingly purposeless mass."
Was Brzezinski another seer and a prophet? Could he see into
the future? The answer is NO; what he wrote in his book was
simply copied from the Committee of 300's blueprint given to
the Club of Rome for execution. Isn't it true that by 1991 we
already have a purposeless mass of citizens? We could say that
30 million unemployed and 4 million homeless people are a
"purposeless mass," or at least the nucleus of one.

                              27

    In addition to religion, "the opiate of the masses" which
Lenin and Marx acknowledged was needed, we now have the
opiates of mass spectator sport, unbridled sexual lusts, rock
music and a whole new generation of drug addicts. Mindless sex
and an epidemic of drug usage was created to distract people
from what is happening all around them. In "The Technotronic
Era" Brzezinski talks about "the masses" as if people are some
inanimate object--which is possibly how we are viewed by the
Committee of 300. He continually refers to the necessity of
controlling us "masses."
    At one point, he lets the cat out of the bag:
    "At the same time the capacity to assert social and political
control over the individual will vastly increase. It will soon be
possible to assert almost continuous control over every citizen
and to maintain up-to-date files, containing even the most per-
sonal details about health and personal behavior of every citizen
in addition to the more customary data.
    "These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the
authorities. Power will  gravitate into the hands of those who
control information. Our existing institutions will be supplanted
by pre-crisis management institutions, the task of which will be
to identify in advance likely social crises and to develop pro-
grams to cope with them. (This describes the structure of FEMA
which came much later. )
   "This  will encourage tendencies through the next several
decades toward a TECHNOTRONIC ERA, A DICTATORSHIP,
leaving even less room for political procedures  as we know
them. Finally, looking ahead to the end of the century, the
possibility of BIOCHEMICAL MIND CONTROL AND GE-
NETIC TINKERING WITH MAN, INCLUDING BEINGS
WHICH WILL FUNCTION LIKE MEN AND REASON LIKE
THEM AS WELL, COULD GIVE RISE TO SOME DIFFICULT
QUESTIONS."
   Brzezinski was not writing as a private citizen but as Carter's
National Security Advisor and a leading member of the Club of

                              28

Rome and a member of the Committee of 300, a member of the
CFR and as a member of the old Polish Black Nobility. His book
explains how America must leave its industrial base behind and
enter into what he called "a distinct new historical era."
    "What makes America unique is its willingness to experience
the future, be it pop-art or LSD. Today, America is the creative
society, the others, consciously or unconsciously, are emulative.
What he  should have  said  was  that America is  the proving
ground for Committee of 300 policies which lead directly to a
dissolution of the old order and an entry into the One World
Government-New World Order.
   One of the chapters in "The Technotronic Era" explains how
new technology will bring in its wake intense confrontation that
will strain social and international peace. Oddly enough we are
already under intense strains through surveillance. Lourdes in
Cuba is one place where this is happening. The other is NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, where  a  giant computer
designated "666" can store data of every type mentioned by
Brzezinski, plus possessing an expanded capacity to take in data
for several billions more people than presently exist, if it ever
comes to that, but which, in the light of the Global 2000 geno-
cidal report, will probably never need to be utilized.
   Retrieval of data will be simple in the United States where
social security and or driver licence numbers could simply be
added to 666 to provide the surveillance recording announced
by Brzezinski and his Committee of 300 colleagues. The Com-
mittee  already  in  1981  warned governments,  including the
government of the USSR, that there "will be chaos unless the
Committee of 300 takes complete control of preparations for the
New World Order. CONTROL WILL BE EXERCISED
THROUGH OUR COMMITTEE AND THROUGH GLOBAL
PLANNIG AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT." I reported this
factual information a few months after I received it in 1981.
Another item I reported back then was that RUSSIA HAD
BEEN INVITED TO JOIN THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE

                              29

COMlNG ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT.
   When I wrote these things in 1981, the conspirators' global
plans were already in an advanced state of preparedness. Look-
ing back over the past 10 years, it can be seen just how rapidly
the Committee's plans have advanced. If the information provided
in 1981  was alarming, then it should be even more alarming
today as we near the final stages of the demise of the United
States as we know it. With  unlimited funding,  with  several
hundred  think  tanks  and  5000  social  engineers, the media
banking and control of most governments a reality, we can see
that we are tracing a problem of immense proportions, one that
cannot he opposed by any nation at this time.
   As I have so often stated, we have been misled into believ-
ing that the problem I am talking about has its origin in Moscow
We have been brainwashed into believing that Communism is
the greatest danger we Americans are facing. This is simply not
so. The greatest danger arises from the mass of traitors in our
midst. Our Constitution warns us to be watchful of the enemy
within our gates. These enemies are the servants of the Committee
of 300  who occupy high positions within our governmental
structure. The UNITED STATES is where we MUST begin our
fight to turn back the tide threatening to engulf us, and where we
must meet, and defeat these internal conspirators.
   The Club of Rome also had a direct hand in creating the 25-
year old war in EI Salvador, as an integral part of the wider plan
drawn up by Elliot Abrams of the U.S. State Department. It was
Committee of 300 member Willy Brandt, leader of the Socialist
International and a former chancellor of West Germany, who
paid for the "final offensive" by the Salvadorian  guerrillas
which, fortunately, was not successful. EI Salvador was chosen
by the committee to turn Central America into a zone for a new
Thirty-Year War, which task was allocated to Kissinger to carry
out under the innocuous title of "The Andes Plan."
    Just to demonstrate how the conspirators operate across all
national boundaries, the "final offensive" action planned  by

                              30

Willy Brandt came about as a result of a visit to Felipe
Gonzalez, who at the time was preparing himself for his Club of
Rome-ordained role as  Spain's future prime minister. Apart
from myself and one or two of my intelligence colleagues and
former colleagues, no one appeared to have heard of Gonzalez
before he surfaced in Cuba. Gonzalez was the Club of Rome's
case officer for EI Salvador, and the first Socialist to be elevated
to political power in Spain since the death of General Franco.
   Gonzalez was on his way to Washington to attend the Club
of Rome Socialist "get Reagan" meeting which took place in
December 1980. Present at the Gonzalez-Castro meeting was
the left-wing guerrilla, Guillermo Ungo, run by the Institute for
Policy Studies (IPS), the Committee of 300's most notorious
Washington-based leftwing think tank. Ungo was run by an IPS
fellow who died in a mysterious plane crash while enroute from
Washington to Havana to visit Castro.
   As  most of us  know, both the left and the  right  of the
political spectrum is controlled by the same people, which will
help to explain the fact that Ungo was a life-long friend of the
late Napoleon Duarte, leader of the rightwing in EI Salvador. It
was after the Cuban meeting that the "final offensive" by the
Salvadorian guerrillas was carried out.
   The polarizing of South America and the U.S was a special
assignment given to Kissinger by the Committee of 300. The
Malvinas War (also known as the Falklands War) and the sub-
sequent overthrow of the Argentine government, followed by
economic chaos and political upheavals, were  planned  by
Kissinger Associates acting in concert with Lord Carrington, a
top-ranking member of the Committee of 300.
   One of the principal Committee of 300 assets in the U.S., the
Aspen Institute of Colorado, also helped plan events in Argentina
even as it did in the case of the fall of the Shah of Iran. Latin
America is important to the United States, not only because we
have so many mutual defense treaties with countries there, but
also because it has the potential of providing a huge market for

                              31

American exports of technology, heavy industrial equipment
which world have galvanized many of our faltering companies
and provided thousands of new jobs. This was to be prevented
all costs, even if it meant 30 years of war.
   Instead of seeing this huge potential in a positive light, the
Committee of 300 saw it as a dangerous threat to its  post-
industrial  zero-growth  U.S. plans and immediately acted to
make an example of Argentina as a warning to other Latin
American nations to forget any ideas they may have had to
promote nationalism, independence and sovereign integrity. This
is the reason why so many Latin American countries turned to
drugs as their sole means of support, which may very well have
been the intention of the conspirators in the first place.
   Americans in general look down on Mexico, which is pre-
cisely the attitude with which the Committee wants the people
of the United States to regard Mexico. What we need to do is
change our thinking about Mexico and South America in general.
Mexico represents a potentially huge market for all types of
U.S. goods which could mean thousands of jobs for Americans
and Mexicans alike. Transferring our industries "south of the
border" and paying the maquiladores slave wages is not in the
interests  of either  country.  It  benefits  nobody  but  the
"Olympians."
   Mexico received most of its nuclear power technology from
Argentina, but the Malvinas War put an end to that. The Club of
Rome decreed back in 1986 that it would stop exports of nuclear
technology to developing countries. With nuclear power stations
generating abundant cheap electricity, Mexico would have be-
come the "Germany of Latin America." Such a state of affairs
would have been a disaster for the conspirators who have, by
1991, stopped all exports of nuclear technology  except that
destined for Israel.
   What the Committee of 300 has in mind for Mexico is a
feudal peasantry, a condition that allows for easy management
and looting of Mexican oil. A stable and prosperous Mexico can

                              32

only be a plus for the United States. This is what the conspira-
tors wish to prevent, so they have engaged in decades of innuendo,
slander and direct economic war on Mexico. Before former
President Lopes Portillo took office and nationalized the banks
Mexico was losing $200 million a day to capital flight, organized
and orchestrated by the Committee of 300's representatives in
banks and brokerage houses on Wall Street.
   If only  we  in  the  United  States  had statesmen and not
politicians running the country, we could act together and set
back the One World Government-New World Order plans to
return Mexico to a state of helplessness.  If we were able to
defeat the Club of Rome's plans for Mexico, it would come as a
shock to the Committee of 300, a shock from which they would
take a long time to recover. The inheritors of the Illuminati pose
as great a threat to the United States as they do to Mexico. By
seeking common ground with Mexican patriotic movements
we in the United States could forge a formidable force to be
reckoned with. But such action requires leadership, and we are
more lacking in leadership than in any other area of endeavor.
   The Committee of 300 through its many affiliated organi-
zations was able to nullify the Reagan presidency. Here is what
Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation had to  say  on the
subject "The right thought it had won in 1980 but in fact it have
lost." What Butler was referring to was the situation in which
the Right found itself when it realized that every single position
of importance  in  the  Reagan  administration  was  filled  by
Fabianist appointees recommended by the Heritage Foundation.
Butler went on to say that Heritage would use rightwing ideas to
impose leftwing radical principles upon the United States, the
same radical ideas which Sir Peter Vickers Hall, top Fabianist in
the U.S. and the number one man at Heritage, had been openly
discussing during the election year.
   Sir Peter Vickers Hall remained an active Fabianist even
though he was running a conservative "think tank." As a mem-
ber of the British oligarchical Vickers armament manufacturing

                              33

family, he had position and power. The Vickers family supplied
both sides in the First World War and again during Hitler's rise
to power. Vickers' official cover was the University of Califor-
nia's  Urban and Regional  Development Institute.  He was a
longtime confidant of British Labour leader and Committee of
300 member Anthony Wedgewood Benn.
   Both Vickers and Benn are integrated with the Tavistock
Institute  for  Human  Relations,  the  premiere  brainwashing
institution in the world. Vickers uses his Tavistock training to
very good effect when speech-making. Consider the following
example:
   "There  are  two Americas.  One  is  the nineteenth  century
heavy-industry based society.  The other is the growing post
industrial society, in some cases built on the shards of the old
America. It is the crisis between these two worlds which will
produce the economic and social catastrophe of the next decade.
The two worlds are in fundamental opposition, they cannot co-
exist. In the end the post industrial world must crush and oblit-
erate the other one." Remember, this speech was made in 1981
and we can see from the state of our economy and our industries
just how accurate was Sir Peter's prediction. When concerned
people ask me how long the 1991 recession will last, I refer
them to Sir Peter's statements and add my own opinion that it
will not end until 1995/1996, and even then what emerges will
not be the America we knew in the 1960's and 1970's. That
America has already been destroyed.
   I reported Sir Peter's speech in my newsletter soon after it
was delivered. How prophetic it was, but then it was easy to
predict a future already written for America by the Committee
of 300 and its executive Club of Rome. What was Sir Peter
saying  in  a  euphemistic  manner?  Translated  into  ordinary
everyday English, he was saying that the old American way of
life, our true and trusted republican form of government based
upon our Constitution, was going to be crushed by the New
World Order. America as we knew it was going to have to go, or

                              34

be crushed to pieces.
   As I said, Committee of 300 members often make them-
selves highly visible. Sir Peter was no exception. To make it
clearly understood where he was coming from, Sir Peter rounded
off his speech by declaring:
   "I am perfectly happy working with the Heritage Foundation
and groups like that. True Fabians look to the New Right to push
through  some  of their more  radical  ideas.  For more  than a 
decade the British population has been subject to a constant
propaganda barrage of how it was on the industrial skids. All of
this is true, but the net effect of the propaganda was to demoralize
the population. (Exactly as intended by the new-science scientist
at Tavistock.)
    "This  will  happen  in  the  United  States  as  the  economy
worsens. This (demoralizing process) is necessary to make people
accept difficult choices. If there is no planning for the future or
if constituencies block progress there will be social chaos on a
scale which is currently hard to imagine. The outlook for urban
America is bleak. There is a possibility of doing something with
the inner cities, but basically the cities will shrink and the
manufacturing base will decline. This will produce social con-
vulsions."
   Was Sir Peter a psychic, a magician of great report or merely
a charlatan fortune teller with a great deal of luck? The answer is
"none of these." All Sir Peter was doing was reading off the
blueprint of the Committee of 300-Club of Rome for slow death
of the United States as a former industrial giant. Looking back
over the ten years of Sir Peter's predictions, can anybody doubt
that the Committee of 300's plans for the demise of an industri-
alized United States has become a fait accompli?
   Haven't Sir Peter's predictions proved to be remarkably
accurate? Indeed they have, almost down to the last word. It is
worth noting that Sir Peter Vickers (Sir Peter Vickers-Hall's
father-in-law) worked on the Stanford Research paper, "Chang-
ing Images of Man," from which much of the 3000 pages of

                              35

material advice sent to the Reagan Administration was taken.
Moreover, as a senior MJ6 British intelligence officer, Sir Peter
Vickers  was  in  a position  to  give  Heritage a great deal of
advance information.
  As a member of the Committee of 300 and NATO, Sir Peter
Vickers was around when NATO directed the Club of Rome to
develop a social program which would utterly change the di-
rection in which America wanted to go. The Club of Rome,
under Tavistock direction, ordered Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) to develop such a program, not only for America, but for
every nation in the Atlantic Alliance and the OECD nations.
   It was Sir Peter's protege, Stuart Butler, who gave President
Reagan 3000 pages of "recommendations," which no doubt
contained some opinions expressed by Anthony Wedgewood
Benn, a member of parliament and a ranking member of the
Committee of 300. Benn told members of the Socialist Interna-
ional who met in Washington on December 8, 1980: "You can
thrive under Volcker's credit collapse if you profile Reagan to
intensify the credit collapse."
   That Butler's advice was taken and applied to the Reagan
administration can be seen in the collapse of the Savings and
loan and banking industries which accelerated under Reagan
economic policies. While Benn called it "profiling," he really
meant that Reagan should be brainwashed. It is worth noting
that Von Hayek-who is a founder member of Heritage-used
his student, Milton Friedman, to preside over the Club of Rome's
plans to deindustrialise America using the Reagan presidency to
accelerate the collapse of first the steel industry, and then the
auto and housing industries, for example.
    In this regard a French Black Nobility member, Etienne
D'Avignon, as a member of the Committee of 300, was assigned
the task of collapsing the steel industry in this country. It is
doubtful that any of the hundreds of thousands of steel workers
and shipyard workers who have been without jobs for the past
decade have ever heard of D'Avignon. I fully reported the

                              36

D'Avignon Plan in April 1981 Economic Review. At-
tending that fateful December lOth Club of Rome meeting in
Washington D.C. was a mystery man from Iran who turned out
to be Bani Sadr, the Ayatollah Khomeini's special envoy.
   One speech in particular at the December 1Oth, 1980 conclave
caught my  attention, mainly because it came from Francois
Mitterand, a man the French establishment had discarded and
thought to be washed up. But my intelligence source had previ-
ously told me that Mitterand was in the process of being picked
up, dusted off and returned to power, so what he said carried a
good deal of weight for me:
   "Industrial capitalist development is the opposite of freedom
We must put an end to it. The economic systems of the 20th and
21st century will use machines to crush man, first in the domain
of nuclear energy which is already producing formidable results.
Mitterand's return to the Elysee Palace was a great triumph for
socialism. It proved that the Committee of 3OO was powerful
enough to predict happenings and then make them happen, by
force, or by whatever means it took to make its point that it
could crush any and all opposition even if, as in the case of
Mitterand, he had been totally rejected a few short days before
by a discerning political power group in Paris.
   Another group representative at the December 1980 Wash-
ington meetings with "observer status" was John Graham, also
known as "Irwin Suall," head of the fact-finding committee of
the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). The ADL is an outright
British intelligence operation run by all three branches of Brit-
ish intelligence, that is, M16 and the JIO. Suall's extensive bag
of dirty tricks was garnered from the sewers of the East End of
London. Suall is still a member of the super-secret SIS, an elite
James Bond type of operation. Let nobody underestimate the
power of the ADL, nor its long reach.
   Suall works closely with Hall and other Fabianists. He was
singled out  as  useful to British intelligence while at Ruskir
Labour College  at Oxford  University  in  England, the same

                              37
  
communist education center that gave us Milner, Rhodes, Bur-
gess, McLean and Kim Philby. Oxford and Cambridge Univer-
sities have long been the province of the sons and daughters of
the elite, those whose parents belong to the "upper crust" of
British high society. While at Oxford, Suall joined the Young
People's Socialist League, and was recruited by British intelli-
gence shortly thereafter.
   Suall was posted to the United States where he came under
the protection  and  sponsorship of one of the most insidious
leftists in the country, Walter Lippmann. Lippmann founded and
ran the League for Industrial Democracy, and Students for
Democratic Society, both leftist spoiler operations to set indus-
trial workers at variance with what it called "the  Capitalist
class" and management. Both of Lippmann's projects were an
integral part of the Committee of 300 apparatus that stretched
right across America, of which Lippmann was a most important
member.
   Suall has strong connections with the Justice Department
and can secure FBI profiles of any person he targets. The Justice
Department has orders to give Suall everything he wants when
he wants it. Most of Suall's activities center around "keeping an
eye on rightwing groups and individuals." The ADL has an open
door to the State Department and makes good use of State's
impressive intelligence agency.
   The State Department has a layer of agents in the right wing,
posing as "fearless anti-Semitic fighters." There are four leaders
in this group of informers, three of whom are discreet Jewish
homosexuals. This spy group has been in operation for the past
two decades. They publish virulently anti-Jewish "newspapers"
and sell a wide variety of anti-Semitic books. One of the principal
operators works out of Louisiana. A member of this group is a
writer who is dearly beloved in Christian rightwing circles. The
group and the individuals who go to make it up are under the
protection of the ADL. Suall was deeply involved in ABSCAM
and is often called upon by law enforcement agencies to assist

                              38

them in investigations and sting operations.
    Suall was assigned to "dog Reagan," in terms of the course
laid out for the newly-elected President by the Heritage Foun-
dation, and to figuratively fire a few warning shots if Reagan
looked like deviating or taking off his blinders at any time. Suall
helped to  get rid of any  troublesome rightwing  advisor not
beholden to Heritage for his or her job with the Reagan admin-
istration. Such a person was Ray Donovan, Reagan's Secretary
of Labor, who was eventually removed from his post thanks to
the Dirty Tricks department of the ADL. James Baker III, one of
those on the list of 3000 recommendations made by the Heritage
Foundation, was the go-between who carried Suall's messages
of hate about Donovan to the President.
   Another  important conspirator  was  Philip  Agee,  the  so-
called CIA "defector." Although not a member of the Commit-
tee, he was nevertheless its case officer for Mexico, and run by
the  Royal  Institute  for  International  Affairs (RIIA) and the
Council  on  Foreign  Relations.  For  the  record, nothing that
happens in the U.S. happens without the sanction of the RIIA. It
is a continuing and ongoing agreement first OPENLY entered
into (there were many such secret agreements before that) by
Churchill and Roosevelt in 1938, under the terms of which U.S.
intelligence services are obliged to share intelligence secrets
with British intelligence.
   This is the basis of the so-called "special relationship" be-
tween the two countries about which Churchill and Lord Halifax
boasted and which "special relationship" was responsible for
the U.S. fighting the Gulf War against Iraq for and on behalf of
British interests, more especially British Petroleum, one of the
most important companies in the Committee of 300 in which
Queen Elizabeth's immediate family has a big stake.
   No intelligence activity has taken place since 1938 except
through this special joint command structure. Philip Agee joined
the CIA after graduating from Notre Dame where he was in-
ducted into its Jesuit Freemason ring. Agee first came to my

                              39

attention in 1968 as the intelligence officer behind the riots at
the University of Mexico. One of the most important things
about the Mexican student riots was that they occurred at the
same time as student rioting in New York, Bonn, Prague and
West Berlin.
    With the coordination expertise and its special intelligence
network of which INTERPOL is an integral part, it is not as
difficult as it might seem at first sight for the Committee to set in
motion carefully timed global actions, whether they be student
rioting or deposing leaders of supposedly sovereign nations. It
is all in a day's work for the "Olympians." From Mexico, Agee
moved on to align himself with Puerto Rican terrorist groups.
During this time he became a trusted confidant of the Cuban
dictator, Fidel Castro.
   It should not be imagined that while Agee was carrying out
these operations, he was doing so as a "rogue" agent. On the
contrary, he was working for the CIA all during these assign-
ments. Trouble came when Castro's DGI (Cuban intelligence
service) was able to "turn" him. Agee continued to work in his
capacity  as  a member of the CIA until his double role was
uncovered. This involved the biggest Soviet listening post in the
West located at Lourdes, Cuba. Staffed by 3000 Soviet special-
ists  in  signals  monitoring and deciphering, Lourdes has the
capability of monitoring thousands of electronic signals simul-
taneously. Many a private phone conversation between a mem-
ber of Congress and his mistress was picked up at Lourdes and
used to telling effect.
   Although we are told today in 1991 that "Communism is
dead," the United States has done nothing to close down the
vast spy operation which sits on our doorstep. Incidentally
Lourdes has the capability of picking up even the weakest
"tempest" signal, which is the type given off by a fax machine or
an electric typewriter which,  when deciphered,  will  give the
contents of whatever is being typed or faxed. Lourdes remains
dagger in the heart of the United States. There is absolutely no

                              40

reason for its continued existence. If the U.S. and USSR are
truly at peace with each other, why the continued need for so
massive a spy operation? The simple truth is that, rather than
retrenching personnel as we are led to believe, the KGB has
taken on additional recruits during 1990 and 1991.
   Bernard Levin is probably not a name that is well-known in
the United States. Unlike decadent "pop stars" or Hollywood's
latest miserable "discovery," academics seldom if ever come
before the public eye.  Of the hundreds of academics  in  the
United States working under the Control of the Club of Rome,
Levin is worthy of special mention, if for no reason other than
his role in undermining Iran, the Philippines, South Africa,
Nicaragua and South Korea. The demise of the Shah of Iran was
run to a plan devised by Bernard Levin and Richard Falk, and
supervised by Robert Anderson's Aspen Institute.
   Levin was the author of a work entitled "Time Perspective
and Morale" which is a Club of Rome publication concerning
how to break down the morale of nations and individual leaders.
Here is an extract of the document:
   "One of the main techniques for breaking morale through a
strategy of terror consists in exactly this tactic: keep the person
hazy as to where he stands and just what he may expect. In
addition,  if frequent vacillations between severe disciplinary
measures  and  promise  of good  treatment  together  with  the
spreading of contradictory news make the structure of the situ-
ation unclear, then the individual may cease to know whether a
particular plan would lead toward or away from his goal. Under
these conditions, even those individuals who have definite goals
and are ready to take risks are paralyzed by the severe inner
conflict in regard to what to do."
   This Club of Rome blueprint applies to COUNTRIES as
well as to individuals, particularly the government leaders of
those countries. We in the U.S. need not think that "Oh well, this
is America, and those kinds of things just do not happen here."
Let me assure you that they ARE happening in the U.S., and

                              41

perhaps more so than in any other country.
   The Levin-Club of Rome plan is designed to demoralize us
all so that in the end we feel we should follow whatever it is that
is planned for us. We WILL follow Club of Rome orders like
sheep. Any seemingly strong leader who SUDDENLY APPEARS
to "rescue" the nation must be regarded with the utmost suspicion.
Remember that Khomeini was groomed for years by British
intelligence, especially during his time in Paris, before he sud-
denly appeared as the savior of Iran. Boris Yeltsin is from the
same M16-SIS stable.
   The Club of Rome feels confident that it has carried out it
Committee of 300 mandate to "soften up" the United States.
After 45 years of waging war on the people of this nation, who
will doubt that it has indeed accomplished its task? Look around
and see how we have been demoralized. Drugs, pornography
rock and roll "music," free sex, the family unit all but totally
undermined, lesbianism, homosexuality and finally the ghastly
murder of millions of innocent babies by their own mothers.
Has there ever been a crime so vile as mass abortion?
   With the U.S. spiritually, morally bankrupted, with our in-
dustrial base destroyed throwing 30 million people out of work
with our big cities ghastly cesspools of every imaginable crime
with a murder rate almost three times higher than any other
country, with 4 million homeless, with corruption in government
reaching endemic proportions, who will gainsay that the United
States is ready to collapse from within, into the waiting arms of
the New Dark Age One World Government?
   The Club of Rome has succeeded in splitting the Christian
churches; it has succeeded in building up an army of charismatics
fundamentalists and evangelicals who will fight for the Zionist
State of Israel. During the Gulf War of genocide I received
scores of letters asking me how I could oppose "a just Christian
war against Iraq." How could I doubt that Christian fundamen-
talist support for the (Committee of 300's) war against Iraq was
not Biblical--after all didn't Billy Graham pray with President

                              42

Bush just before the shooting started? Doesn't the Bible speak
of "wars and rumors of wars" ?
   These letters give an insight into just how well the Tavistock
Institute has done its work. The Christian fundamentalists will
be  a formidable force behind  the  state  of Israel,  exactly as
planned. How sad that these fine people do not realize that they
have been GROSSLY MISUSED by the Club of Rome and that
their opinions and beliefs are NOT THEIR OWN, but those
created for them by the hundreds of Committee of 300 "think
tanks" that dot the American landscape. In other words, like any
other segment of the United States population, the Christian
fundamentalists and evangelicals have been thoroughly
brainwashed.
   We as a nation are ready to accept the demise of the United
States of America and the American way of life, once the envy
of the entire world. Do not think this has happened on its own--
the old "times are changing" syndrome. Time does not change
anything, PEOPLE do. It is a mistake to think of the Committee
of 300 and the Club of Rome as European institutions. The Club
of Rome exercises great influence and power in  the  United
States, and has its own chapter based in Washington D.C.
   Senator Claiborne Pell is its leader, and one of its members
is Frank M. Potter, a one-time staff director of the House Sub-
committee on Energy. It is not difficult to see how the Club of
Rome has maintained its grip on U.S. energy policies and where
"environmentalist" opposition to nuclear energy is coming from.
Perhaps the Club's greatest success story is its hold over Con-
gress in regard to nuclear energy which has had the effect of
preventing the U.S. from entering the 21st century as a strong
industrial nation. The effect of the anti-nuclear policy of the
Club of Rome can be measured in terms of silent blast furnaces.
derelict railroad yards, rusting steel mills, shipyards long since
closed down and a valuable trained work force scattered across
the United States, which may never again be assembled.
  Other Club of Rome members in the U.S. are Walter A.

                              43

Hahn of the Congressional Research Service, Ann Cheatham
and Douglas Ross, both senior economists. Ross's task, in his
own words, was to "translate Club of Rome perspectives into
legislation to help the country  get away from the illusion of
plenty. "  Ann  Cheatham  was  the  director of an  organization
called "Congressional Clearing House For The Future."
   Her task was to profile members of Congress who would be
susceptible to astrology and New Age mumbo-jumbo. At one
stage she had in excess of 100 Congressmen in her classes.
Daily sessions were held in which a variety of astrological
"forecasts" were made based on her "occult perceptions." Besides
Congressmen, other prominent people who attended her sessions
were  Michael Walsh,  Thornton  Bradshaw--A LEADING
MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE OF 300--and David
Sternlight, a senior vice-president of Allstate Insurance Company.
   Some of the more important members of the Committee of
300 are also members of NATO, a fact which we ought to
remember. These Committee of 300 members often hold several
offices. Among the NATO-Club of Rome membership are found
Harland Cleveland, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, Joseph
Slater, a director of the Aspen Institute, Donald Lesh, a former
staffer in the U.S. National Security Agency, George McGhee
and Claiborne Pell, to name a few examples.
   It is important that we remember these names, make a list of
them if you wish, so as to recall who they are and what they stand
for when their names come up in television programs and news
services. Following intelligence modus vivendi, leaders of the
Committee often appear on television, usually in the most innocent
of guises. We ought to be aware that nothing they do is innocent.
   The Committee of 300 has planted its agents in the muscle
and sinew of the United States, in its government, in Congress, in
advisory posts around the President, as ambassadors and as
Secretaries of State. From time to time the Club of Rome holds
gatherings and conferences which, although they appear under
innocuous titles, break up into action committees, each of which

                              44

is assigned a specific task and a specific target date by which time
their assignments must be completed. If it does nothing else, the
Committee of 300 is working to a very specific time-table.
   The first Club of Rome conference in the United States was
called by the Committee of 300 in 1969 under the title: "The
Association of the Club of Rome." The next meeting was held in
1970 under the title "Riverdale Center of Religious Research"
and was directed by Thomas Burney. Then followed the Wood-
lands Conference held in Houston, Texas, starting in  1971
Thereafter, regular conferences have been held at Woodlands
every year.
   Also in 1971, at a later date, the Mitchell Energy and Devel-
opment Corporation held its energy strategy meeting for the
Club of Rome: The recurring theme: LIMIT THE GROWTH
OF THE U.S.A. Then to crown it all, the First Global Conference
on the Future was held in July of 1980, attended by 4000 social
engineers and members of think tanks, all of whom were men-
bers of or affiliated with various institutions operating under
Club of Rome umbrella organizations.
   The First Global Conference on the Future had the blessing
of the White House which held its own conference based on the
transcripts of the First Global Conference forum. It was called
the "White House Commission on the 1980's" and OFFICIALLY
recommended the policies of the Club of Rome "as a guide to
future U.S. policies" and even went so far as to say that the
United States economy is moving out of the industrial phase
This echoed the theme of Sir Peter Vickers Hall and Zbibniew
Brzezinsky and provides further proof of the control exercised
by the Committee of 300 over U.S. affairs, both domestic and
foreign.
    As I said in 1981, we are set up, politically, socially and
economically so that we remain locked into the Club of Rome's
plans. Everything is RIGGED against us. If we are to survive
then we must break the stranglehold the Committee of 300 has
on our government. In every election since Calvin Coolidge ran

                              45
                              
for the White House, the Committee of 300 has been able to
plant its agents in key positions in government so that it matters
not who gets the White House post. For example, every one of
the candidates  who ran for the Presidency, from the time of
Franklin D. Roosevelt, were selected, some like to call it "hand
picked,"  by  the  Council on Foreign Relations  acting on the
instructions of the RIIA.
   Especially in the  1980 election, every  candidate for the
highest office in the United States was run by the CFR. Therefore
it was  of no consequence to the conspirators  who won the
presidential race. Through such Trojan Horses as the Heritage
Foundation and the CFR, ALL key policy making positions in
the new administrations were filled by the Council on Foreign
Relations nominees, and before that, since the 1960's, by NATO-
Club of Rome yes-men, thereby ensuring that key policy deci-
sions bore the indelible stamp of the Club of Rome and the CFR,
acting as the executive arms of the Committee of 300.
   Both the  1984 and  1988 elections followed this long-
established pattern. Secretary of State George Schultz was the
perfect choice of the Committee of 300 for the office of Secretary
of State. Schultz was always a creature of Henry Kissinger, the
ruling order-giver for the CFR.  Moreover, his position with
Bechtel, a key Committee of 300 company of global dimensions,
gave him access to countries that might otherwise have been
suspicious of his Kissinger connection. The Carter Administration
accelerated the process of key pro-conspiracy personnel in key
positions. Before Carter was elected, his key campaign strategist,
Hamilton Jordan, said that if Cyrus Vance or Brzezinski received
appointments in the Carter cabinet, he, Jordan, would resign.
They did. Jordan did not resign.
   Carter's  choice of Paul Volcker (in fact he was  told to
appoint Volcker by David Rockefeller) started the collapse of
the U.S. economy according to the plan laid down by the Club
of Rome.  We are up against powerful forces who are dedicated
to the goal of a One World Government. We have been engaged

                              46

in a devastatingly crippling war for the past 45 years, only it is
not perceived as such. We are brainwashed, methodically and
systematically, without ever being aware of it. The Tavistock
Institute provided the system for this to take place, and then set
its operations in motion.
   The only way we can fight back is by exposing the conspira-
tors and their multiplicity of front organizations. We need men
with  experience  who  can  formulate  strategy  to  defend  our
priceless heritage which, once lost, will never again reappear.
We need to learn the methods the conspirators use; learn them
and adopt counter-measures. Only a crash program will stop the
rot which is consuming our nation.
   Some may have difficulty in accepting the idea of a global
conspiracy because so many writers have made financial gain
from it. Others doubt that activity on a global scale can be
successfully advanced. They see the huge bureaucracy of our
government and then say, "Well, how are we supposed to believe
that private people can do more than the government does?
This overlooks the fact that government is part of the conspiracy.
Hard evidence is what they want and hard evidence is difficult
to come by.
   Others say, "So what. What do I care about a conspiracy, I
don't even bother to vote." That is exactly the way the general
population of America was profiled to react. Our people have
become discouraged and confused, the results of 45 years of
warfare conducted against us. How this is done is explained in
Bernard Lewin's book, but how many people would bother to
read an academic's non-fiction book? We are reacting exactly as
we were profiled to act. Demoralized and confused people will
be far more ready to welcome the sudden appearance of a great
man who promises to solve every problem and guarantee a well-
ordered society in which people are fully employed and domes-
tic strife is minimal. Their dictator, for that is who it will be, will
be welcomed with open arms.
   Knowing WHO the enemy is a vital necessity. No one can

                              47

fight and against an unidentified enemy. This book could be
used as a military field manual. Study its content and memorize
all names. I have mentioned profiling techniques quite frequently
in this chapter. A full explanation of "profiling" is contained in
the next chapter. One of the most profound pieces of information
to come out of the science of profiling is the relative ease in
which this can be accomplished in individuals, party groups,
political entities and so on right on down the line. Once we wake
up as to how easy this is to do, the conspiracy will no longer be
more than we can comprehend. The assassination of President
Kennedy and the attempt on the life of President Reagan become
easy to understand.

               INSTITUTlONS THROUGH WHICH

                  CONTROL IS EXERCISED

   Profiling is a technique developed in 1922 on command of
the Royal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA). Major John
Rawlings Reese, a British Army technician, was instructed to
set up the largest brainwashing facility in the world at the
Tavistock Institute for Human Relations as a part of Sussex
University.  This became  the core of Britain's  Psychological
Warfare Bureau. When I first introduced the names of Reese and
Tavistock into the United States in 1970, very little interest was
shown. But over the years, as I revealed more and more about
Tavistock  and its  vital role  in the conspiracy,  it has become
popular to imitate my earlier research.
   Britain's Psychological Warfare Bureau made extensive use
of the work done by Reese on his 80,000 British Army guinea
pigs, captive soldiers who underwent many forms of testing. It
was Tavistock-designed methods that got the United States into
the Second World War and which, under the guidance of Dr.
Kurt Lewin, established the OSS, the forerunner of the CIA.
Lewin became the director of the Strategic Bombing Survey,

                              48

which was a plan for the Royal Air Force to concentrate on
bombing German worker housing while leaving military tar-
gets,  such as munition plants, alone. The munition plants on
both sides belonged to the international bankers who had no
wish to see their assets destroyed.
   Later, after the war was over, NATO ordered Sussex Univer-
sity to establish a very special brainwashing center which became
part of Britain's Psychological Warfare Bureau, only now, its
research was directed toward civilian rather than military ap-
plications. We shall return to that super secret unit which was
called  Science  Policy  Research  Institute  (SPRI) under our
chapters on drugs.
   The  idea  behind  saturation  bombing  of civilian  worker
housing was to break the morale of the German worker. It was
not designed to affect the war effort against the German military
machine.  Lewin  and his  team of actuaries  reached  a target
figure, that if 65% of German worker housing was destroyed by
nightly RAF bombing, the morale of the civilian population
would collapse. The actual document was prepared by the Pru-
dential Assurance Company.
   The RAF, under the command of "Bomber" Harris, carried
out Lewin's plans, culminating in the terror firestorm bombing
of Dresden, in which over 125,000, mainly old men, women and
children,  were killed. The truth of "Bomber" Harris's horror
raids on German civilians was a well kept secret until long after
the end of WW II.
   Tavistock provided most of the detailed programs that led to
the establishing of the Office of Naval Intelligence, (ONI) the
number one intelligence service in the United States, one which
dwarfs the CIA in size and scope. Contracts worth billions of
dollars were given to Tavistock by the United States Government
and Tavistock's  strategic planners provide most of what the
Pentagon uses for our defense establishment, even today. Here
again is illustrated the grip the Committee of 300 has on the
United States, and the majority of our institutions. Tavistock

                              49

runs over 30 research institutions in the United States, all of
which we will name in our charts at the end of the book.
   These Tavistock-U.S. institutions have in many cases grown
into gargantuan monsters, penetrating every aspect of our gov-
ernment agencies and taking command of all policy making.
One of Tavistock's chief wreckers of our way of life was Dr.
Alexander King, a founder member of NATO and a favorite
with the Committee of 300, as well as an outstanding member of
the Club of Rome. Dr. King was assigned by the Club of Rome
to destroy America's education by taking control of the National
Teachers Association and working in close conjunction with
certain law makers and judges. If it was not generally known
how all-pervading is the influence of the Committee of 300, this
book should dispel every vestige of that doubt.
   The trial run for the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA)   a Club of Rome creation   came in a test run against
the  nuclear  power  station  at Three Mile Island, Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania. Termed "an accident" by the hysterical media,
this was not an accident but a deliberately designed crisis test
for FEMA. An additional benefit was  the fear and hysteria
created by the news media which had people fleeing the area
when in fact they were never in any danger.
   It was considered a success by FEMA and it scored a lot of
points for the anti-nuclear forces. TMI became the rallying 
point for the so-called "environmentalists," a highly financed and
controlled group run out of Aspen Institute on behalf of the Club
of Rome. Coverage was provided free of charge by William
Paley of CBS television, a former British intelligence agent.
   FEMA is a natural successor to the Strategic Bombing Survey
of WW II. Dr. Kurt Lewin, theoretician for what the Tavistock
conspirators called crisis management, was deeply involved in
the  study.  There  is  an  unbroken  chain between  Lewin  and
Tavistock that stretches back for thirty-seven years. Lewin in-
corporated the Strategic Bombing Survey into FEMA, with only
a few small adjustments proving necessary, one of the changes

                              50
                                               
being the target, WHICH WAS NO LONGER GERMANY BUT
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Forty-five years after
the end of WW II it is still Tavistock that has its hands on the
trigger, and the weapon is pointed at the United States.
   The late Margaret Mead conducted an intensive study of the
German and Japanese population, under the aegis of Tavistock,
on how they reacted to stress caused by aerial bombardment.
Irving Janus was an associate professor on the project which
was  supervised by  Dr.  John  Rawlings  Reese,  promoted  to
Brigadier-General in the British Army. The test results  were
given to FEMA. The Irving Janus report was of great value in
formulating FEMA policies. Janus used it in a book which he
later wrote entitled AIR WAR AND STRESS. The ideas in his book
were followed TO THE LETTER BY FEMA DURING THE
THREE MILE ISLAND "CRISIS." Janus had a really simple
idea: Simulate a succession of crises and manipulate the popu-
lation following the Lewin terror tactics and they will do exactly
as required.
   In carrying out this exercise, Lewin discovered something
new, that social control on a wide scale can be achieved by using
the news media to bring home the horrors of a nuclear war via
the television media. It was discovered that women's magazines
were very effective in dramatizing the terrors of a nuclear war. A
trial run conducted by Janus had Betty Bumpers, wife of Sena-
tor Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, "writing" for McCalls magazine
on that subject.
   The article appeared in McCalls January 1983 issue. Actu-
ally, Mrs. Bumpers did not write the article, it was created for
her by a group of writers at Tavistock whose speciality such
subject matters are. It was a collection of untruths, non-facts,
innuendoes and conjectures based entirely upon false premises.
The Bumpers article was typical of the kind of psychological
manipulation at which Tavistock is so very good. Not one of the
ladies who read McCalls could have failed to be impressed by
the terror-horror story of what a nuclear war looks like.

                              51

   The Committee of 300 has a major bureaucracy at its dis-
posal made up of hundreds of think tanks and front organizations
that run the whole gamut of private business and government
leaders. I will mention as many as I can fit in, starting with the
German Marshall Fund. Its members, and remember they are
also members of NATO and the Club of Rome, consist of David
Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan Bank, Gabriel Hague of the
prestigious Manufactures Hanover Trust and Finance Corpora-
tion, Milton Katz of the Ford Foundation, Willy Brandt, leader
of Socialist International, KGB agent and member of the Com-
mittee of 300, Irving Bluestone, chairman of the United Auto
Workers Executive Board, Russell Train, U.S. president of the
Club of Rome and Prince Philip's World Wildlife Fund, Elizabeth
Midgely, CBS programs producer, B. R. Gifford, director of the
Russell Sage Foundation, Guido Goldman of the Aspen Institute
the  late Averill  Harriman,  Committee  of 300  extraordinary
member, Thomas L. Hughes of the Carnegie Endowment Fund,
Dennis Meadows and Jay Forrestor of MIT "world dynamics."
   The Committee of 300, although in existence for over 150
years, did not take on its present form until around 1897. It was
always given to issuing orders through other fronts, such as the
Royal Institute for International Affairs. When it was decided
that a  super-body  would control European  affairs,  the  RIIA
founded the Tavistock Institute, which in turn created NATO.
For Five years NATO was financed by the German Marshall
Fund. Perhaps the most important member of the Bilderbergers,
a foreign policy body of the Committee, was Joseph Rettinger,
said  to  have  been  its  founder and organizer, whose annual
meetings have delighted conspiracy hunters for several decades.
    Rettinger was a well-trained Jesuit priest and a 33rd Degree
Freemason. Mrs. Katherine Meyer Graham who is suspected of
having murdered her husband in order to get control of the
Washington Post, was another ranking member of the Club of
Rome, as was Paul G. Hoffman of the New York Life Insurance
Company, one of the largest insurance companies in the United

                              52

States and a leading Rank company, with ties directly to Queen
Elizabeth of England's immediate family. John J. McCloy, the
man who attempted to wipe post-World War II Germany off the
map and last but not least, James A. Perkins of the Carnegie
Corporation, were also founding members of the Bilderbergers
and the Club of Rome.
   What a star-studded cast! Yet strangely enough, few if any
outside of genuine intelligence agencies had ever heard of this
organization until recent times. The power exercised by these
important personages and the corporations, television stations
newspapers,  insurance  companies  and  banks  they  represent
matches the power and prestige of at least two European coun-
tries, and still this is only the tip of The Committee of 300's
enormous cross-gridding and interfaced interests.
   Not mentioned in the foregoing line-up is Richard Gardner
who, although an early member of the Committee of 300, was
sent to Rome on a special assignment. Gardner married into one
of the oldest Black Nobility families of Venice, thus providing
the Venetian aristocracy a direct line to the White House. The
late Averill Harriman was another of the committee's direct
links with the Kremlin and the White House, a position which
Kissinger inherited after the death of Harriman.
   The Club of Rome is indeed a formidable agency of the
Committee of 300. Although ostensibly working on American
affairs, the group overlaps other Committee of 300 agencies and
its United States members are often found working with "prob-
lems" in Japan and Germany. Some of the front organizations
operated by the above committee include the following, although
not limited to them:

LEAGUE OF INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY
   Officials:  Michael  Novak,  Jeane  Kirkpatrick,  Eugene
Rostow, IRWIN SUALL, Lane Kirkland, Albert Schenker.
   Purpose: To disrupt and disturb normal labor relations be-
tween workers and employees by brain washing labor unions to

                              53

make impossible demands with special attention to steel, auto-
mobile and housing industries.

FREEDOM HOUSE
   Officials: Leo Churn and Carl Gershman.
   Purpose: To spread socialist disinformation among Ameri-
can blue collar workers, spread dissension and dissatisfaction.
Now that these objectives have been largely realized, Gershman
has been drafted by Lawrence Eagleburger to CEDC, a newly
created body to stop a united Germany from expanding its trade
into the Danube Basin.

COMMITTEE FOR A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY
   Officials: Ben Wattenburg, Jean Kirkpatrick, Elmo Zumwa
and Midge Dector.
   Purpose: To provide a connecting link between the edu-
cated  socialist  class  and  minority  groups  with  the  intent of
setting up a solid block of voters who can be counted on to vote
for leftwing candidates at election time. It was really a Fabianist
operation from start to finish.

FOREIGN POLICY RESEARCH INSTITUTE
    Officials: Robert Strausz Hupe.
   Purpose: To undermine and eventually end NASA space
program.

SOCIAL DEMOCRATS U.S.A.
   Officials: Bayard Rustin, Lane Kirkland, Jay Lovestone,
Carl Gershman, Howard Samuel, Sidney Hook.
   Purpose:  To  spread radical  socialism,  especially  among
minority groups, and forge links between similar organizations
in socialist countries. Lovestone was for decades the leading
advisor to U.S. presidents on Soviet affairs and a strong direct
link with Moscow.

INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL RELATIONS
   Officials: Harland Cleveland, Willis Harmon.
   Purpose: Change the way America thinks.

THE CITIZENS LEAGUE
   Officials: Barry Commoner.
   Purpose: To bring "common cause" legal suits against vari-
ous government agencies, especially in the defense industries.

WAR RESISTERS LEAGUE
   Officials: Noam Chomsky and David McReynolds.
   Purpose: To organize resistance to the Vietnam War among
leftwing groups, students and the Hollywood "in crowd."

THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST ORGANIZING
COMMITTEE OF THE INSTITUTE FOR
DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM
   Officials:  Frank  Zeider, Arthur  Redier  and David
McReynolds.
   Purpose: A clearing house for leftwing socialist ideas and
activities in the U.S and Europe.

ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE  FACT FINDING
DIVISION
   Officials: IRWIN SUALL, also known as John Graham.
   Purpose: A joint FBI-British intelligence operation designed
to single out rightwing groups and their leaders and put them out
of business before they grow too large and too influential.

INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS
   Purpose: A labor oriented front for the Socialist Interna-
tional and a hot-bed of organized labor unrest polarizing work-
ers and management.

                              55

AMALGAMATED CLOTHING WORKERS
   Officials:  Murray Findley,  IRWIN  SUALL and Jacob
Scheinkman.
   Purpose: Much the same as the Machinists Union, to so-
cialize and polarize workers in the garment trade.

A. PHILIP RANDOLPH INSTITUTE
   Officials: Bayard Rustin.
   Purpose: To provide a means of coordinating organizations
with a common purpose, an example of which would be the
spread of socialist ideas among college students and workers.

CAMBRIDGE POLICY STUDIES INSTITUTE
    Officials: Gar Apelrovitz.
   Purpose: To expand on the work being done at the Institute
for Policy Studies. Founded in February 1969 by international
socialist, Gar Apelrovitz, former assistant to Senator Gaylord
Nelson. Apelrovitz wrote the controversial book ATOMIC DI-
PLOMACY for the Club of Rome which work was financed by
the German  Marshall Fund.  It concentrates  on research and
action projects, with a stated goal of fundamentally changing
American society, i.e., to create a Fabianist United States in
preparation of the coming One World Government.

ECONOMIC COMMITTEE OF THE NORTH
ATLANTIC INSTITUTE
    Officials: Dr. Aurellio Peccei.
   Purpose: NATO think-tank on global economic issues.

CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF DEMOCRATIC
INSTITUTIONS
   Officials: Founder Robert Hutchins of the Committee of
300, Harry Ashmore, Frank Kelly and a large group of "Fellows."
   Purpose: To spread ideas that will bring on social reforms

                              56

of the liberal kind with democracy as an ideology. One of its
activities is to draft a new constitution for the U.S. which will be
strongly monarchical and socialistic as found in Denmark.
    The Center is an "Olympian" stronghold. Located in Santa
Barbara,  it  is  housed  in  what  is  affectionately  called  "the
Parthenon." Former Representative John Rarick called it "an
outfit loaded with Communists." By 1973 work on a new United
States Constitution was in its thirty-fifth draft which proposes
an amendment guaranteeing "environmental right," the thrust of
which is to reduce the industrial base of the U.S. to a mere
whisper of what it was in 1969. In other words, this institution is
carrying out Club of Rome zero-growth post-industrial policies
laid down by the Committee of 300.
   Some of its  other aims  are control  of economic  cycles,
welfare, regulation of business and national public works, con-
trol of pollution. Speaking on behalf of the Committee of 300,
Ashmore says the function of the CSDI is to find ways and
means of making our political system work more effectively.
"We must change education and we must consider a new U.S
Constitution and a Constitution for the world," Ashmore says.
   Further goals enunciated by Ashmore are as follows:
   (1) Membership of the U.N. must be made universal.
   (2) The U.N. must be strengthened.
   (3) South East Asia must be neutralized. (For neutralized,
       read "Communized.")
   (4) Cold War must be ended.
   (5) Racial discrimination must be abolished.
   (6) Developing nations must be assisted. (Meaning assisted
       to destruct.)
   (7) No military solutions to problems. (Pity they didn't tell
       George Bush that before the Gulf War.)
   (8) National solutions are not adequate.
   (9) Coexistence is necessary.

scientists.
   Purpose: To create a climate where the Committee of 300
can take unlimited power over the U.S.

INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH
   Officials:  Dr.  Kurt  Lewin  and  staff of 20  new-science
scientists.
   Purpose: To devise a whole new set of social programs to
steer America away from industry.

SCIENCE POLICY RESEARCH UNIT
   Officials: Leland Bradford, Kenneth Dam, Ronald Lippert.
   Purpose: A "Future Shocks" research institution at Sussex
University in England and part of the Tavistock network.

SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
   Officials:  Sheldon Arenberg and a staff of hundreds, too
numerous to mention here.
   Purpose:  To  coordinate  all  elements  of the  intelligence
communities of the U.S.A. and Britain. It analyzes what "play-
ers" have to be assigned the role of a national entity; for example,
Spain  would come  under a  supine  watered-down Catholic
Church, the U.N. under the Secretary General and so forth. It
developed the system of "X RAY 2" where think tank personnel,
military installations and law enforcement centers are all linked
to the Pentagon through a nation-wide network of Teletypes and
computers: To apply surveillance techniques on a nation-wide
scale. Arenberg says his ideas are non-military, but his techniques
are mainly those he learned from the military. He was responsible
for the New York State Identification and Intelligence System, a
typical  George  Orwell  "1984"  project,  which  is  completely
illegal  under our Constitution. The NYSIIS  system is in the
process  of being  adopted  nationwide.  It  is  what  Brzezinsk

                              58

referred to as the ability to almost instantaneously retrieve data
about any person.
   NYSIIS shares data with all law enforcement and govern-
ment agencies in the state. It provides storage and rapid retrieval
of individual records,  criminal  and  social.  It  is  a TYPICAL
Committee of 300 project. There is a crying need for a full
investigation to be conducted into just what it is that Systems
Development Corporation is doing, but that is beyond the scope
of this book. One thing is sure, SDC is not there to preserve
freedom and liberty guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. How
convenient that it should be located in Santa Barbara in easy
reach of Robert Hutchins "Parthenon." Some publications put
out by these Club of Rome institutions are as follows:
       "Center Magazine"
       "Counterspy"
       "Coventry"
       "Covert Action Information Bulletin"
       "Dissent"
       "Human Relations"
       "Industrial Research"
       "Inquiry"
       "Mother Jones"
       "One"
       "Progressive"
       "Raconteur"
       "The New Republic"
       "Working Papers for a New Society"
   These are by no means all of the publications issued under
the auspices of the Club of Rome. There are many hundreds
more, in fact each of the foundations puts out its own publication.
Given the number of foundations run by the Tavistock Institute
and the Club of Rome, a partial listing is all we can include here.
Some of the more important foundations and think tanks are in
the following list, which includes Army think tanks.
   The American public would be astounded if it only knew

                              59

how deeply the Army is involved in "new war tactics" research
with Committee of 300 "think tanks." Americans are not aware
that in 1946 the Club of Rome was ordered by the Committee of
300 to further the progress of think tanks which it said offered a
new means of spreading the Committee's philosophy. The impact
of these think tanks upon our military, just since 1959 when they
suddenly proliferated, is truly astounding. There is no doubt that
they will play an even  greater role in the daily affairs of this
nation as we come to the close of the 20th century.

THE MONT PELERIN SOCIETY
   Mont Pelerin is an economic foundation devoted to issuing
misleading economic theories and influencing economists in the
Western world to follow models it lays out from time to time. Its
leading practitioners are Von Hayek and Milton Friedman.

THE HOOVER INSTITUTION
   Founded originally to fight Communism, the institution has
slowly but surely turned toward Socialism. It has an annual
budget of $2 million, funded by companies under the umbrella
of the Committee  of 300.  It  now concentrates  on  "peaceful
changes"  with emphasis on arms control and domestic U.S.
problems. It is Frequently used by the news media as a "conser-
vative" organization whose views they seek when a conservative
viewpoint is needed. The Hoover Institution is far from that, and
following the 1953 take-over of the Institution by a group allied
to the Club of Rome, it has become a One World-New World
Order outlet for "desirable" policies.

HERITAGE FOUNDATION
   Founded by  brewery  magnate Joseph  Coors  to  act as a
conservative  think  tank,  Heritage  was  soon  taken  over  by
Fabianists Sir Peter Vickers Hall, Stuart Butler, Steven Ayzlei,
Robert Moss and Frederich Von Hayek under the direction of
the Club of Rome. This institute played a major role in carrying

                              60

out British Labour leader Anthony Wedgewood Benn's order to
"Thatcherize Reagan." Heritage is certainly not a conservative
operation although at times it may look and sound like one.

HUMAN RESOURCES RESEARCH OFFICE.
   This  is  an Army  research  establishment  dealing  in
"psychotechnology." Most of its personnel are Tavistock-trained.
"Psychotechnology" covers GI motivation, morale and music
used by the enemy. In fact a lot of what George Orwell wrote
about in his book "1984" appears to be remarkably similar to
what is taught at HUMRRO. In 1969, the Committee of 300
took over this important institution and turned it into a private
non-profit organization run under the auspices of the Club of
Rome. It is the largest behavioral research group in the U.S.
   One of its specialities is the study of small groups under
stress and HUMRRO teaches the Army that a soldier is merely
an extension of his equipment and has brought great influence
to bear on the "man/weapon" system and its "human quality
control,"  so  widely  accepted by  the  United  States Army.
HUMRRO has had a very pronounced effect on how the Army
conducts itself. Its mind-bending techniques are straight out of
Tavistock.  HUMRRO'S applied psychology courses are sup-
posed to teach Army brass how to make the human weapon
work. A good example of this is the manner in which soldiers in
the war against Iraq were willing to disobey their field manual
standing orders and bury 12,000 Iraqi soldiers alive.
   This type of brainwashing is terribly dangerous because
today, it is applied to the Army, the Army applies it to brutally
destroy thousands of "enemy" soldiers, and tomorrow the Army
could be told that civilian population groups opposed to gov-
ernment policies are "the enemy." We are already a mindless
brainwashed flock of sheep, yet it seems that HUMRRO can
take mind bending and mind control a step further. HUMRRO is
a valuable adjunct to Tavistock and many of the lessons taught
at HUMRRO were applied in the Gulf War, which makes it a

                              61

little  easier to  understand how  it came to be  that American
soldiers behaved as ruthless and heartless killers, a far cry from
the concept of the traditional American fighting man.

RESEARCH ANALYSlS CORPORATION.
   This is HUMRRO'S sister "1984" organization situated in
McLean, Virginia. Established in 1948, it was taken over by the
Committee of 3OO in 1961 when it became part of the Johns
Hopkins bloc. It has worked on over 600 projects, including
integrating Negroes into the Army, the tactical use of nuclear
weapons, psychological warfare programs and mass population
control.
   Obviously there are many more major think tanks, and we
shall come to most of them in this book.  One of the most
important areas of cooperation between what think tanks turn
out and what becomes government and public policy are the
"pollsters." It is the job of the polling companies to mold and
shape public opinion in the way that suits the conspirators. Polls
are constantly being taken by CBS-NBC-ABC, the New York
Times, the Washington Post. Most of these efforts are coordi-
nated at the National Opinion Research Center where, as much
as it will amaze most of us, a psychological profile was developed
for the entire nation.
   Findings  are fed into the  computers  of Gallup Poll  and
Yankelovich, Skelley and White for comparative evaluation.
Much of what we read in our newspapers or see on television
has first been cleared by the polling companies. WHAT WE
SEE IS WHAT THE POLLSTERS THINK WE SHOULD SEE.
This is called "public opinion making." The whole idea behind
this bit of social conditioning is to find out how responsive the
public is to POLICY DIRECTIVES handed down by the Com-
mittee of 300. We are called "targeted population groups" and
what is measured by the pollsters is how much resistance is
generated to  what appears  in the "Nightly  News."  Later,  we
shall learn exactly how this deceptive practice got started and

                              62

who is responsible for it.
   It is all part of the elaborate opinion-making process created
at, Tavistock. Today our people believe they are well-informed
but what they do not realize is that the opinions they believe are
their own were in fact created in the research institutions and
think tanks of America and that none of us are free to form our
own opinions because of the information we are provided with
by the media and the pollsters.
   Polling  was  brought to a fine art just before the United
States entered the Second World War. Americans, unbeknown to
themselves, were conditioned to look upon Germany and Japan
as dangerous enemies who had to be stopped. In a sense, this
was  true,  and  that makes  conditioned thinking all the more
dangerous, because based on the INFORMATlON fed to them,
the enemy did indeed appear to be Germany and Japan. Just
recently  we  saw how  well Tavistock's conditioning process
works when Americans were conditioned to perceive Iraq as a
threat and Saddam Hussein as a personal enemy of the United
States.
   Such a conditioning process is technically described as "the
message reaching the sense organs of persons to be influenced."
One of the most respected of all pollsters is Committee of 300
member Daniel Yankelovich,  of the company, Yankelovich,
Skelley and White. Yankelovich is proud to tell his students that
polling is a tool to change public opinion, although this is not
original, Yankelovich having drawn his inspiration from David
Naisbett's book "TREND REPORT" which was commissioned
by the Club of Rome.
   In his book Naisbett describes all of the techniques used by
public opinion makers to bring about the public opinion desired
by the Committee of 300. Public opinion making is the jewel in
the crown of the OLYMPIANS, for with their thousands of new-
science social scientists at their beck and call, and with the news
media firmly in their hands, NEW public opinions on almost
any subject can be created and disseminated around the world in

                              63

a matter of two weeks.
   This is precisely what happened when their servant George
Bush was ordered to make war on Iraq. Within two weeks, not
only the U.S. but almost the entire world public opinion was
turned against Iraq and its President Saddam Hussein. These
media change artists and news manipulators report directly to
the Club of Rome which in turn reports to the Committee of 300
at whose head sits the Queen of England ruling over a vast
network of closely-linked corporations who never pay taxes and
are answerable to no one, who fund their research institutions
through foundations  whose joint activities  have  almost total
control over our daily lives.
   Together with their interlocking companies, insurance busi-
ness, banks, finance corporations, oil companies, newspapers,
magazines, radio and television, this vast apparatus sits astride
the United  States  and the  world.  There is not a politician in
Washington D.C. who is not, somehow, beholden to it. The Left
rails against it, calling it "imperialism" which indeed it is, but
the left is run by the same people, the very  same ones who
control the right, so that the left is no more free than we are!
   Scientists engaged in the process of conditioning are called
"social engineers" or "new-science social scientists" and they
play an integral part in what we see, hear and read. The "old
school" social engineers were Kurt K. Lewin, Professor Hadley
Cantril, Margaret Meade,  Professor Derwin Cartwright  and
Professor Lipssitt who, together with John Rawlings Reese,
made up the backbone of new-science scientists at Tavistock
Institute.
   During the Second World War, there were over  100 re-
searchers at work under the direction of Kurt Lewin, copying
slavishly the methods adopted by Reinhard Heydrich of the S.S.
The OSS was based on Heydrich's methodology and, as we
know, the OSS was the forerunner of the Central Intelligence
Agency. The point of all this is that the governments of Britain
and the United States already have the machinery in place to

                              64

bring us into line in a New World Order with only a slight
modicum of resistance materializing, and this machinery has
been in place since 1946. Each passing year has added new
refinements.
    It is this Committee of 300 which has established control
networks and mechanisms far more binding than anything ever
seen in this world. Chains and ropes are not needed to restrain
us. Our fear of what is to come does that job far more efficiently
than any physical means of restraint. We have been brainwashed
to give up our Constitutional right to bear arms; to give up our
Constitution  itself;  to  allow  the United Nations to exercise
control over our foreign policies and the IMF to take control of
our fiscal  and monetary policies; to permit the President to
break United States law with impunity and to invade a foreign
country  and kidnap its head-of-state.  In short we have been
brainwashed to the extent where we, as a nation, will accept
each  and  every  lawless  act carried out by  our  government
almost without question.
   I for one know that we will soon have to fight to reclaim
our country from the Committee, or lose it forever. BUT when
it comes right down to it, how many will actually take up arms?
In 1776 only 3% of the populace took up arms against King
George III. This time around, 3% will be woefully inadequate.
We should not allow ourselves to be led down dead-end roads,
for that is what our mind controllers have planned for us by
confronting us with such a complexity of issues that we simply
succumb to long range penetration and make no decisions at all
on many vital issues.
   We shall be looking at the names of those who make up the
Committee of 300 but, before we do that, we should examine
the massive interfacing of all important institutions, companies
and banks under the Committee's control. We must mark them
well because these are the people who are deciding who shall
live and who shall be eliminated as "useless eaters"; where we
will worship God, what we must wear and even what we shall

                              65

eat. According to Brzezinski, we shall be under endless surveil-
lance around the clock for 365 days a year ad infinitum.
   That we have been betrayed from within is being accepted
by more and more people each year, and that is good, because it
is through knowledge, a word translated from the word BE-
LIEF, that we shall be able to defeat the enemies of all mankind.
While we were being distracted by the bogeymen in the Krem-
lin, the Trojan Horse was moved into position in Washington
D.C. The greatest danger free people face today is not from
Moscow but from Washington D.C. We need first to conquer the
DOMESTIC ENEMY, and after that we will be strong enough
to mount an offensive to remove Communism from the earth
together with all of its attendant "isms."
   The Carter Administration accelerated the collapse of our
economy and our military strength, the latter begun by Club of
Rome and Lucis Trust member Robert Strange McNamara. In
spite of his promises, Reagan continued to undermine our in-
dustrial base, starting where Carter left off. While we need to
keep our defenses strong, we cannot do that from a weak in-
dustrial base for, without a well-run military-industrial complex,
we cannot have a viable defense system. The Committee of 300
recognizes this and planned from 1953 its zero-growth post-
industrial policies now in full flower.
   Thanks to the Club of Rome our technology potential has
dropped below that of Japan  and Germany,  nations  we  are
supposed to have defeated in the Second World War. How has
this come about? Because of men like Dr. Alexander King and
our blindfolded state of mind, we have failed to recognize the
destruction  of our  educational  institutions  and  systems  of
teaching. As a result of our blindness, we are no longer training
engineers and scientist in sufficient numbers to keep us among
the industrialized nations of the world. Thanks to Dr. King, a
man very few people in America know about, education in the
U.S. is at its lowest level since 1786. Statistics produced by the
Institute for Higher Learning show that the reading and writing

                              66

capabilities of high school children the  United States are
LOWER than they were among high school children in 1786.
   What we face today is not only the loss of our freedom and
the very fabric of our nation, but far worse, the possibility of the
loss of our souls. The steady chipping away at the foundation
upon which this republic rests has left an empty void,  which
satanists and cultists are rushing to fill with their synthetic soul
material. This truth is difficult to accept and appreciate because
there was nothing SUDDEN about these events. If a sudden
shock were to hit us, a cultural and religious shock, we would be
shaken out of our apathy.
   But gradualism--which is what Fabianism is, does nothing
to raise the alarm. Because the vast majority of Americans can
see no MOTIVATION for the things I have described, they
cannot accept it, and so the conspiracy is scorned and often
mocked.  By  creating  chaos  through presenting hundreds  of
daily choices our people have to make, we have come down to a
position where,  unless motivation can be clearly  shown,  all
information is rejected.
   This is both the weak and the strong link in the conspirato-
rial chain. Most thrust aside anything that has no motive, so the
conspirators feel safe behind the ridicule poured upon those
who point to the coming crisis in our nation and our individual
lives. However, if we can get enough people to see the truth, the
motivation block gets weaker until it will eventually be forced
aside as more and more people become enlightened and the
notion that "this cannot happen in America" is dispensed with.
   The Committee of 300 is counting on our maladaptive re-
sponses to govern our reaction to created events, and it will not
be disappointed as long as we as a nation continue in the present
way we respond. We must turn responses to created crises into
ADAPTIVE responses by identifying the conspirators and ex-
posing their plans for us, so that these things become public
knowledge. The Club of Rome has already made THE TRAN-
SITION TO BARBARISM. Instead of waiting to be "raptured,"

                              67

we must stop the Committee of 300 before it can accomplish its
goal of making us prisoners of the" New Dark Age" planned for
us. It is not up to God, IT IS UP TO US. We have to take the
necessary action.
   All information that I provide in this book comes from years
of research  backed  up  by  impeccable  intelligence  sources.
Nothing is exaggerated. It is factual and precise so do not fall
into the trap set by the enemy that this material is "disinforma-
tion." For the past two decades I have provided information
which has proved to be highly accurate and which has explained
a lot of puzzling events. My hope is that through this book, a
better,  clearer and wider understanding  of the  conspiratorial
forces ranged against this nation will come about. That hope is
being realized as more and more young people are beginning to
ask questions and seek information about what is REALLY
going on.
   It is difficult for people to comprehend that these conspira-
tors are real and that they have the power I and many others
have attributed to them. Many have written to ask how it is that
our government does nothing about the terrible threat to civili-
zation? The problem is that our government is PART of the
problem, part of the conspiracy, and nowhere and at no time has
this become more clearly evident than during the Bush Presi-
dency.  Of course President Bush knows precisely  what the
Committee of 300 is doing to us. HE WORKS FOR THEM.
Others have written to say, "We thought we were fighting the
government." Of course we are, but behind government stands a
force so powerful and all-encompassing that intelligence agen-
cies are even afraid to mention the name "Olympians."
   Proof of the Committee of 300 is found in the vast number of
powerful institutions owned and controlled by it. Listed here are
some of the more important ones, all of which come under the
MOTHER OF ALL THINK TANKS AND RESEARCH INSTI-
TUTIONS, THE TAVISTOCK INSTITUTE OF HUMAN RE-
LATIONS with its far-flung network of hundreds of "branches."

                              68

STANFORD RESEARCH CENTER
   Stanford Research Center (SRC) was founded in 1946 by
the Tavistock Institute For Human Relations. Stanford was cre-
ated to help Robert 0. Anderson and his ARCO oil company,
who had secured for the Committee of 300 the oil rights on the
North  Slope of Alaska. Basically, the job was too large for
Anderson's Aspen Institute to handle, so a new center had to be
founded and funded. That new center was Stanford Research
Center. Alaska sold its rights on a downpayment of $900 million,
a relatively small amount for the Committee of 300. The governor
of Alaska was steered to SRI for help and advice. This was no
accident but the result of judicious planning and a process of
long-range conditioning.
    Following the governor's call for help, three SRI scientists
set up shop in Alaska where they met with the Alaskan Secretary
of State and the State Planning Office. Francis Greehan, who
headed the SRI team, assured the Governor that his problem of
how to handle the rich oil find would be safe in the hands of
SRI. Naturally Greehan did not mention the Committee of 300
or the Club of Rome. In less than a month Greehan assembled a
team of economists, petroleum scientists and new-science sci-
entists numbering in the hundreds. The report SRI gave to the
Governor ran to eighty-eight pages.
   The proposal was adopted virtually without change by the
Alaska legislature in 1970. Greehan had indeed done a remark-
able job for the Committee of 300. From this beginning SRI
developed into an institution employing 4000 people with an
annual budget of $160 million plus. Its President, Charles A.
Anderson, has seen much of this growth during his tenure, as
has Professor Willis Harmon, director of the SRI Center for the
Study of Social Policies, employing hundreds of new-science
scientists, many of the top staffers having been transferred from
Tavistock's London base. One of those was RCA board chair-
man and former British intelligence agent, David Sarnoff, who
was closely involved with Harmon and his team for twenty-five

                              69

years. Sarnoff was something of a "watchdog" for the mother
institute in Sussex.
   Stanford claims to make no moral judgments on projects it
accepts, working for Israel and the Arabs, South Africa and
Libya but, as one would imagine, by adopting this attitude it
ensures an "inside edge" with foreign governments that the CIA
has found most useful. In Jim Ridgeway's book, "THE CLOSED
CORPORATION," SRI spokesman Gibson brags about SRI's
non-discriminatory stance. Although not on the Federal Contract
Research Center lists, SRI is today the largest military think tank,
dwarfing Hudson and Rand. Among SRl's speciality depart-
ments are chemical and biological warfare experimental centers.
   One of Stanford's  more dangerous  activities  is  counter-
insurgency operations aimed at civilian populations--just the
sort of "1984" things government is already using against its
own people. The U.S. government pays SRI millions of dollars
each year for this kind of highly controversial "research." Fol-
lowing student protests against chemical warfare experiments
conducted at Stanford, SRI "sold" itself to a private group for
just $25 million. Of course nothing really changed, SRI was still
a Tavistock project and the Committee of 300 still owned it, but
the gullible appeared to be satisfied by this meaningless cosmetic
change.
   In 1958 a startling new development arose. Advanced Re-
search Products Agency (ARPA), a contracting agency for the
Defense Department, approached SRI with a top secret pro-
posal.  John  Foster  at the Pentagon told  SRI that what was
needed  was  a  program  to  insure  the United States against
"technological surprise." Foster wanted to perfect a condition
where the environment became a weapon; special bombs to
trigger volcanos and/or earthquakes, behavioral research on
potential enemies and minerals and metals with potential for
new  weapons.  The project was  accepted by SRI and code-
named "SHAKY."
   The massive electronic brain in SHAKY was capable of

                              70

carrying out many commands, its computers having been con-
structed by IBM for SRI. Twenty-eight scientists worked on
what is  called "Human Augmentation." The  IBM computer
even has the capability to solve problems by analogy and rec-
ognizes and identifies scientists who work with it. The "special
applications" of this tool can be better imagined than described.
Brzezinski knew what he was talking about when he wrote
"THE TECHNOTRONIC ERA."
   Stanford Research Institute works closely with scores of
civilian consulting firms, trying to apply military technology to
domestic situations. This has not always been a success, but as
techniques  improve,  the prospects for massive  all-pervading
surveillance, as described by Brzezinski, daily becomes more
real. IT ALREADY EXISTS AND IS IN USE, EVEN THOUGH
SLIGHT MALFUNCTIONS FROM TIME TO TIME HAVE
TO BE IRONED OUT. One such civilian consulting firm was
Schriever McKee Associates of McLean, Virginia, run by retired
General Bernard A. Schriever, a former chief of the Air Force
Systems Command, who developed the Titan, Thor, Atlas and
Minuteman rockets.
   Schriever put together a consortium of Lockheed, Emmerson
Electric, Northrop, Control Data, Raytheon and TRW under the
name of URBAN SYSTEMS ASSOCIATES, INC. The purpose
of the consortium? To solve social and psychological "urban
problems"  by  means  of military  techniques  using  advanced
electronic systems. It is interesting to note that TRW became the
largest credit information collecting company  in the  credit-
reporting business as a result and an outcome of its work with
Urban Systems Associates, Inc.
   This should tell us a great deal about just how far this nation
is already under TOTAL SURVEILLANCE, which is the first
requirement of the Committee of 300. No dictatorship, espe-
cially  not one on a  global  scale, can function without total
control over each and every individual. SRI was well on its way
to becoming a key Committee of 300 research organization.

                              71

   By the  1980's, 60% of SRl's contracts were devoted to
"Futurism" with both military and civilian applications. Its ma-
jor clients were the U.S. Department of Defense-Directorate of
Defense Research and Engineering, Office of Aerospace Re-
search which dealt with "Applications of the Behavioral Sciences
to Research Management," Executive Office of the President,
Office of Science and Technology, U.S. Department of Health.
On behalf of the Department of Health, SRI ran a program
called "'Patterns in ESDEA Title I Reading Achievement Tests."
Other clients were the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S.
Department of Labor, U.S. Department of Transportation and
the National Science Foundation (NSF). Of significance was the
paper developed for NSF, entitled "Assessment of Future and
International Problems."
   Stanford Research, under the tutelage of Tavistock Institute
in London, put together a far reaching and chilling system it
called "Business Intelligence Program." In excess of 600 com-
panies in the U.S. and abroad became subscribers. The program
covered research in Japanese Foreign Business Relations, Con-
sumer Marketing in a Period of Change, The Mounting Challenge
of International Terrorism,  Sensory Evaluation in  Consumer
Products,  Electronic  Funds  Transfer  System,  Opto-Electric
Sensing, Exploratory Planning Methods, the U.S. Defense In-
dustry and Capital Availability. Among the TOP Committee of
300 companies who became clients of this program were Bechtel
Corporation (George Schultz was on its board), Hewlett Packard,
TRW, Bank of America, Shell Company, RCA, Blyth, Eastman
Dillon, Saga Foods Corporation, McDonnell Douglas, Crown
Zellerbach, Wells Fargo Bank and Kaiser Industries.
   But one of the most sinister of all SRI programs with the
possibilities of doing tremendous damage in altering the direc-
tion in which the United States will go, socially, morally and
religiously, was Stanford's Charles F. Kettering Foundation's
"CHANGING IMAGES  OF MAN" under Stanford official
reference "Contract Number URH (489)-2150 Policy Research

                              72

Report Number 4/4/74, Prepared by the SRI Center for the Study of
Social Policy, Director Willis Harmon." This is probably one of
the most far-reaching investigations into how man might be
changed that has ever been conducted.
    The report, covering 319 pages, was written by  14 new
science scientists under the supervision of Tavistock and 23 top
controllers  including B. F. Skinner, Margaret Meade,  Ervin
Lazlo and Sir Geoffrey Vickers, a high-level British intelligence
officer in M16. It will be recalled that his son-in-law, Sir Peter
Vickers Hall, was a founding member of the so-called conser-
vative "Heritage Foundation." Much of the 3000 pages of "rec-
ommendations" given to the Reagan administration in January
1981 were based upon material taken from Willis Harmon's
"CHANGING IMAGES OF MAN."
   I was privileged to receive a copy of "THE CHANGING
IMAGES OF MAN" from my intelligence colleagues five days
after it was accepted by the United States government. What I
read shocked me, as I realized I was looking at a blueprint for a
future America,  unlike anything I had ever seen before. The
nation was to be programmed to change and become so accus-
tomed to such planned changes that it would hardly be noticeable
when profound changes did occur. We have gone downhill so
fast since "THE AQUARIAN CONSPIRACY" (the book title
of Willis  Harmon's technical paper)  was  written,  that today,
divorce draws no stigma, suicide is at an all time high and raises
few  eyebrows,  social  deviations  from  the  norm  and  sexual
aberrations,  once  unmentionable  in  decent  circles,  are  now
commonplace and excite no special protest.
   As a nation we have not noticed how "CHANGING IMAGES
OF MANKIND" has radically altered our American way of life
forever. Somehow we were overcome by the "Watergate Syn-
drome." For a while we were shocked and dismayed to learn
that Nixon was nothing but a cheap crook who hobnobbed with
Earl Warren's Mafia friends at the beautiful home they built for
him adjoining the Nixon estate. When too many "future shocks"

                              73

and news headlines demanded our attention, we lost our way, or
rather, the huge number of choices with which we were and still
are daily confronted, confused us to such a degree that we were
no longer able to make the necessary choices.
   Worse yet, having been subjected to a barrage of crimes in
high places, plus the trauma of the Vietnam War, our nation
seemed  no  longer to  want truths.  Such reaction  is  carefully
explained  in  Willis  Harmon's  technical  paper, in short, the
American nation was reacting exactly as profiled. Worse yet, in
not wishing to accept truth, we took matters a step further: We
looked to government to shield us from the truth.
   The corrupt stench of the Reagan-Bush Administrations we
wanted covered with six feet of earth. The crimes committed
under the title of Iran/Contra affair (or scandals), we didn't want
uncovered. We let our President lie to us regarding his where
abouts in the period October 20-23rd, 1980. Yet these crimes far
exceed in quantity and scope anything Nixon did while he was
in office. Do we as a nation recognize it as going downhill with
our brakes off?
   No, we do not. When those whose business it is to bring the
truth to the American people that a private, well-organized little
government inside the White House was busy committing one
crime after another, crimes which attacked the very soul of this
nation and the republican institutions upon which it rested, we
were told not to bother the public with such things. "We really
don't want to know about all this speculation," became a stan-
dard response.
   When the highest elected official of the land blatantly put
U.N. law above the Constitution of the United States--an im-
peachible offense, the majority accepted it as "normal." When
the highest elected official of the land went to war without a
Congressional declaration of war, the fact was censored out by the
news media and, again, we accepted it rather than face the truth.
   When the Gulf War, which our President plotted and planned,
began, not only were we happy with censorship of the most

                              74

blatant kind, we even took it to our hearts, believing that it was
"good tor the war effort." Our President lied, April Glaspie lied,
the  State Department lied.  They  said the  war  was justified
because President Hussein had been warned to leave Kuwait
alone. When Glaspie's cables to the State Department were
finally made public,  one United States  Senator after another
went charging to defend Glaspie, the harlot. It mattered not that
they came from both the Democrats and the Republicans. We,
the people, let them get away with their vile lies.

--- Committee of 300 - Part 4 ---------------------------------------------


   In this public attitude of the American people, the wildest
dreams of Willis Harmon and his teams of scientists became a
reality.  The  Tavistock  Institute was elated at its success in
destroying the self respect and self esteem of this once great
nation. We are told that we won the Gulf War. What is not yet
perceived by the vast majority of Americans is that, in winning
the war, it cost the self respect and honor of our nation. That lies
rotting in the desert sands of Kuwait and Iraq, alongside the
corpses of the Iraqi soldiers we butchered in the agreed retreat
from Kuwait and Basra--we could not keep our word that we
would abide by the Geneva Conventions and not attack them.
"What do you want," our controllers asked us, "victory or self
respect? You can't have both."
   One hundred years ago, this could not have happened, but
now it has happened and excites no comment. We have suc-
cumbed to the long range penetration warfare waged against
this nation by Tavistock. Like the German nation, defeated by
the Prudential Bombing Survey, enough of us have succumbed
to make this nation the kind that totalitarian regimes of the past
would have only envisaged in their dreams. "Here," they would
say, "is a nation, one of the largest in the world, that doesn't
want the truth. All of our propaganda agencies can be dispensed
with. We don't have to struggle to keep the truth from this
nation, they have willingly rejected it of their own volition. This
nation is a pushover."
   Our once proud Republic of the United States of America

                              75

became no more than a series of criminal front organizations,
which history shows is always the start of totalitarianism. This
is the stage of permanent alteration we are at in America as 1991
drew to a close. We live in a throw-away society, programmed
not to last. We do not even flinch at the 4 million homeless nor
the 30 million jobless, nor the 15 million babies murdered thus
far. They are "throw-aways" of the Age of Aquarius, a conspiracy
so damnable that, when first confronted with it, the majority
will disavow its existence, rationalizing these events as "times
have changed."
   This is how the Tavistock Institute and Willis Harmon pro-
grammed us to react. Dismantling of our ideals goes on without
protest. The spiritual and intellectual drive of our people has
been destroyed! On May 27th, 1991, President Bush made a very
profound statement, the thrust of which appears to have been
totally misused by most political commentators:

   "The moral dimension of American policy requires us to
    chart a moral course through a world of lesser evils. That
   is the real world, not black and white. Very few moral
    absolutes."

   What else could we expect from a President who is most
probably the most evil man ever to occupy the White House?
    Consider this in the light of his order to the military to bury
alive  12,000  Iraqi  soldiers.  Consider this in the light of his
ongoing  war of genocide against the Iraqi people. President
Bush was delighted to characterize President Saddam Hussein
as the "Hitler of our times." He never bothered to offer a single
scrap of proof. It was not needed. Because President Bush made
the statement, we accepted it without question. Consider this in
the bright light of truth, that he did all of these things in the
name of the American people while secretly taking his orders
from the Committee of 300.
   But, more than anything else, consider this: President Bush

                              76

and his controllers feel so secure that they no longer deem it
necessary to hide their evil control of the American people, or to
lie about it. This is self-evident in the statement that he, as our
leader, will make all manner of compromises with truth, hon-
esty and decency if his controllers (and ours) deem it necessary.
On May 27th, 1991, the President of the United States abandoned
each  and  every  principle  embodied  in  our  Constitution  and
boldly proclaimed that he was no longer bound by it. This is a
great  victory  for  the  Tavistock  Institute  and  the  Prudential
Bombing Survey, whose target changed from German worker
housing in 1945 to the soul of the American people in a war that
began in 1946 and runs through to 1992.
   Increased pressure on this nation for change was applied by
Stanford Research Institute in the early 1960's. SRl's offensive
gathered power and momentum. Switch on your television set
and you will see Stanford's victory in front of your very eyes:
talk shows featuring heavy sexual details, special video channels
where perversion, rock and roll and drugs reign supreme. Where
once John Wayne ruled, we now have a made-over apology for a
man (or is he?) called Michael Jackson, a parody of a human
being who is held up as a hero, as he gyrates, shuffles, mumbles
and screams his way across television screens in millions of
American homes.
  A woman who has been through a series of marriages gets
national coverage.  One filthy, half-washed drug-ridden deca-
lent rock band after another has hours of air time devoted to its
inane sounds and mad gyrations, clothes fashions and language
aberrations.  Soap operas showing as near as "dammit" is to
wearing pornographic scenes  draw no comment. Whereas in
early  1960 this would never have been tolerated, today it is
accepted as  normal. We have been subjected and we have
succumbed to  what Tavistock Institute calls  "future  shocks"
whose future is NOW and we are so numbed by one cultural
shock after another that to protest seems like a futile gesture
and, therefore, logically we think, it does no good to protest.

                              77
                  
   In 1986 the Committee of 300 ordered the pressure turned
up. The U.S. was not going down fast enough. The United States
began the process of "recognizing" the butchers of Cambodia,
the criminal Pol Pot regime, self confessors to the murder of 2
million Cambodian citizens. In 1991, the wheel turned the full
circle. The United States went to war against a friendly nation
that had been programmed to trust the Washington traitors. We
accused President Hussein of the small nation of Iraq of all
manner of evil, NONE OF WHICH WAS EVEN REMOTELY
TRUE. We killed and maimed its children, we left them to
starve and to die of all manner of diseases.
   In  the  same  breath  we  sent  the  Bush  emissaries  of the
Committee of 300 to Cambodia to RECOGNIZE THE EVIL
MASS MURDERERS OF 2 MILLION CAMBODIANS, who
were  sacrificed by the Committee of 300's  depopulation of
cities experiment, which the big cities of the United States will
experience in the not too distant future. Now, President Bush
and his Committee of 300-ridden administration say, in effect,
"Look people, what do you want from me? I told you that I will
compromise where I see fit, even when that means sleeping with
the Pol Pot murderers. SO WHAT--KISS MY HIPS."
   The level of pressure for change will reach its peak in 1993
and we shall witness scenes such as we would never have
thought possible. Punch drunk America will react, but ever so
slightly. Not even the latest threat to our freedom, the personal
computer card disturbs us. Willis Harman's "CHANGING IM-
AGES OF MAN" would have been too technical for most so the
service  of Marilyn Ferguson was  obtained to make  it more
easily understood. "THE AGE OF AQUARIUS" heralded nude
stage shows and a song which made the top of the charts:  "The
Dawning of the Age of the Aquarius" swept the globe.
   The personal computer card which, when fully distributed,
will deprive us of our familiar environment and, as we shall see,
environment means a lot more than the usually accepted mean-
ing of the word. The United States has gone through a period of

                              78

intense trauma such as has never been visited on any other
nation in the history of the world, and the worst is yet to come.
   Everything is  going according to what Tavistock ordered
and what the social scientists at Stanford mapped out. Times do
not change; they are made to change. All changes are preplanned
and come as the result of careful action. We have been changed
gradually at first, but now the pace of change is picking up. The
United States is being transformed from One Nation Under God
to a polyglot of nations under several gods. The U.S. is  no
longer One nation under God. The framers of the Constitution
have lost the battle.
   Our forebears spoke a common language and believed in a
common religion Christianity, and held common ideals. There
were no aliens in our midst; that came later in a deliberately
planned attempt to break up the United States into a series of
fragmented nationalities, cultures and beliefs. If you doubt this,
go down to the East Side of New York, or the West Side of Los
Angeles  on  any  given  Saturday and look around you.  The
United States has become several nations struggling to coexist
under a common system of government. When the floodgates of
immigration were opened wide by Franklin D. Roosevelt, a
cousin of the head of the Committee of 300, the cultural shock
caused great confusion and dislocation and made "One Nation"
an unworkable concept. The Club of Rome and NATO have
exacerbated the situation. "Love thy neighbor" is an ideal that
will not work unless your neighbor "is as yourself."
   To the framers of our Constitution, the truths they laid out
For future generations were "self evident"--to themselves  Be-
ing unsure that future generations would also find the truths to
which they bound this nation self evident, THEY SET ABOUT
SPELLlNG THEM OUT. IT SEEMS THAT THEY WERE
AFRAID OF A TIME THAT MIGHT COME WHEN THE
TRUTHS THEY ESPOUSED WOULD NO LONGER BE
SELF-EVIDENT. The Tavistock Institute for Human Relations
has made sure that what the framers feared might come to pass

                              79

has indeed come to pass. That time has arrived with Bush and
his "no absolutes" and his New World Order under the Committee
of 300.
   This is part of the concept of social changes forced upon
Americans which Harmon and the Club of Rome said would
make for severe trauma and a great building up of pressure. The
social  upheavals  that  have  taken  place  since  the  advent of
Tavistock, the Club of Rome and NATO will continue in the U.S.
for as long as the limit of absorption is ignored. Nations are made
up of individuals and, like individuals, there is a limit to their
ability to absorb changes, no matter how robust they may be.
   This psychological truth was well proven by the Strategic
Bombing Survey which called for saturation bombing of Ger-
man worker housing. As mentioned earlier, the project was the
work of the Prudential Insurance Company and no one doubts
today that Germany suffered its defeat because of this operation.
Many of the scientists who worked on that project are working
on saturation bombing of America, or else they have passed on,
leaving  their  skilled techniques  in the hands  of others  who
followed behind them.
   The legacy they left behind them can be found in the fact
that we have not so much lost our way as a nation, but that we
have  been  steered in  a direction opposite  to  that  which  the
framers of the Declaration guided us for over 200 years. We
have, in short, lost contact with our historical genes, our faith,
which inspired countless  generations of Americans  to move
forward as a nation, benefiting from the patrimony left to us by
the framers of the Declaration of Independence and the United
States Constitution. That we are lost is clear to all who seek the
truth, as unpleasant as it may be.
   With President Bush and his "no absolute morals" guiding
us, we blunder ahead as lost nations and individuals tend to do.
We are collaborating with the Committee of 300 for our own
downfall and our own enslavement. Some sense it--and feel a
strong sense of unease. The various conspiracy theories they are

                              80

familiar with do not seem to cover it all. This is because they
know nothing of the Conspirators'Hierarchy, The Committee
of 300.
   These souls who feel a deep sense of unease and that some-
thing is radically wrong, yet cannot put their collective fingers
on the problem, walk in darkness. They look to a future they see
slipping away from them. The American dream has become a
mirage. They place their faith in religion but take no steps to
help that faith along by ACTION. Americans will never experi-
ence a retracing of steps  such as the Europeans experienced
when at the height of the Dark Ages. By determined ACTlON,
they awoke in themselves a spirit of renewal which resulted in
the glorious Renaissance.
   The enemy that has directed them to this point decided to
make a strong move against the United States in 1980, so that
Renaissance of America would be impossible. Who is the enemy?
The enemy is no faceless "they." The enemy is clearly identifi-
able as the Committee of 300, the Club of Rome, NATO and all
of its affiliated organizations, the think tanks and research in-
stitutions  controlled by  Tavistock.  There  is  no  need  to  use
"they" or "the enemy" except as shorthand. WE KNOW WHO
"THEY," THE ENEMY, IS. The Committee of 300 with its
Eastern Liberal Establishment "aristocracy," its banks, insurance
companies,  giant corporations,  foundations,  communications
networks, presided over by a HIERARCHY OF CONSPIRA-
TORS--THIS IS THE ENEMY.
   This is the power that brought to life the reign of terror in
Russia, the Bolshevik Revolution, World Wars I and II, Korea,
Vietnam, the fall of Rhodesia, South Africa, Nicaragua, and the
Philippines.  This  is  the  secret  upper-level  government  that
brought into existence the controlled disintegration of the U.S.
economy and deindustrialized what was once the greatest indus-
rial power, for good, that the world had ever known.
   America today can be compared with a soldier who falls
asleep in the thick of battle. We Americans have fallen asleep,

                              81

given way to apathy caused by being confronted with a mult-
plicity of choices which has confused us. These are the changes
that alter our environment, break down our resistance to change
so that we become dazed, apathetic and eventually fall asleep in
the thick of battle.
    There is a technical term for this condition. It is called "long
range penetration strain." The  art of subjecting  a very  large
group of people to continued long range penetration strain was
developed by scientists working out of the Tavistock Institute of
Human Relations and their U. S. subsidiaries, Stanford Research
and Rand Corporation, and at least another 150 research institu-
tions here in the U.S.
   Dr. Kurt Lewin, the scientist who developed this fiendish
warfare, has caused the average American patriot to fret over
various conspiracy theories, leaving him or her with a feeling of
uncertainty and insecurity, isolated and perhaps even afraid, as
he searches, but fails to understand the decay and rot caused by
"THE CHANGING IMAGES OF MANKIND," unable to
identify  or combat the  social,  moral,  economic  and political
changes he deems undesirable and does not want, yet which
increase in intensity on every hand.
   Dr. Lewin's name will not be found in any of our establish-
ment history books which, in any event, are a record of events
mostly from the side of the ruling class or the victors of wars.
Therefore, it is with pride that I introduce his name to you. As
mentioned before, Dr. Lewin organized the Harvard Psycho-
logical Clinic and the Institute for Social Research under the
auspices of the Tavistock Institute.  The names do not give much
indication of the purpose of the two organizations.
   This reminds me of the infamous bill to reform coinage and
mint laws passed in 1827. The title of the bill was harmless
enough or sounded harmless, which was the intention of its
backers. Through this Act, Senator John Sherman betrayed the
nation into the hands of the international bankers.  Sherman
allegedly sponsored the bill "without reading it." As we know,

                              82

the bill's true purpose was to demonetize silver and give the
thieving bankers unlimited power over the credit of our nation;
powers to which the bankers were clearly not entitled under the
clear and unmistakable terms of the U.S. Constitution.
   Kurt Lewin gave the Tavistock Institute, the Club of Rome
and NATO unlimited power over America, to which no organi-
zation, entity or society is entitled. These institutions have used
the usurped powers to destroy the will of the nation to resist the
plans and intentions of the conspirators to rob us of the fruits of
the American  Revolution  and  steer us  on  a  course  leading
directly to a New Dark Ages under a One World Government.
   Lewin's colleagues in this long range penetration objective
were Richard Crossman, Eric Trist, H. V. Dicks, Willis Harmon,
Charles Anderson, Garner Lindsay, Richard Price and W. R.
Bion. Again, these names never appear in the evening news; in
fact, they only appear in scientific journals--so very few Ameri-
cans are aware of them and not at all aware of what the men
behind the names have done and are doing to the United States.
   President Jefferson once said he pitied those who thought
they knew what was taking place through reading the newspaper.
Disraeli, the British prime minister, said much the same thing.
Indeed, down through the ages, rulers have delighted in running
things from behind the scenes. Man has always felt the need to
dominate and nowhere and at no time is the desire more preva-
lent than in this modern era.
   If it were not so, why all the need for secret societies? If we
are  ruled  by  an  open  system run  by  democratically  elected
officials,  why  the  need for a  secret Masonic order in every
village, town and city across the United States? How is it that
Freemasonry can operate so openly and yet keep its secrets so
well hidden? We can't ask the Nine Unknown Men of the Nine
Sisters Lodge in Paris that question, nor can we ask it of their
nine fellows in the Quatuar Coronati Lodge in London. Yet
these eighteen men form part of an even more secret govern-
ment, the RIIA, and beyond that, the Committee of 3OO.

                              83

   How is it that the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry could brain-
wash John Hinckley to shoot President Reagan? Why do we
have such secret orders as the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem,
the Round Table, the Milner Group and so on down line upon
line of secret societies? They form part of a world-wide chain of
command and control running through the Club of Rome, NATO,
the RIIA and finally right up to the Conspirators' Hierarchy,
The Committee of 300. Men need these secret societies because
their deeds are evil and must be hidden. Evil cannot stand in the
light of truth.
   In this book we shall find an almost complete list of the
conspirators, their institutions, fronts and publications. In 1980
the Aquarian Conspiracy was in full swing and its success can
be  seen in every facet of our private and national  life.  The
overwhelming rise in mindless violence, serial killers, teenage
suicides, the unmistakable signs of lethargy--"long range pen-
etration" is a part of our new environment, as dangerous, if not
more so, than the polluted air that we breathe.
   The coming of the Age of Aquarius caught America totally
unprepared. We as a nation were not prepared for the changes
about to be forced upon us. Who ever had heard of Tavistock,
Kurt Lewin, Willis Harmon and John Rawlings Reese? They
were not even on the American political scene. What we would
have noticed, if we bothered to look at all, was a falling off of
our ability to withstand futuristic shock as we became more
fatigued, distressed and eventually entered a period of psycho-
logical shock followed by widespread apathy as an outward
manifestation of long range penetration warfare.
   The Age of Aquarius was best described by Tavistock Institute
as the vehicle for delivering turbulence: "There are three distinct
phases in the response and reaction to stress displayed by large
social groups. First, there is superficiality; the population under
attack will defend itself with slogans; this does not identify the
source of the crisis and therefore does nothing to address it,
hence the crisis will persist. The second is fragmentation. This

                              84

occurs  as the crisis continues and social order breaks down.
Then, there is the third phase where the population group goes
into 'self realization' and turns away from the induced crisis and
there follows a maladaptive response, accompanied with active
synoptic idealism and disassociation."
   Who can deny that with the huge increase in drug usage--
"crack" making thousands of instant new addicts each day--the
shocking rise in the murder of infants each day (aborticide),
which by  now far exceeds casualties  suffered by our armed
forces in both World Wars, Korea and Vietnam, the open accep-
tance of homosexuality and lesbianism whose "rights" are pro-
tected by more and more laws each year, the terrible plague we
call "AIDS" washing over our towns and cities, total failure of
our education system, the stunning increase in the divorce rate, a
murder rate that shocks  the rest of the world into disbelief,
satanic serial killings, the disappearance of thousands of young
children, snatched off our streets by perverts, a virtual tidal wave
of pornography accompanied by "permissiveness" on our tele-
vision screens--who can deny that this nation is in crisis, which
we are not addressing and from which we are turning away.
   Well-meaning people who specialize in these things blame a
lot of the problem on education, or what passes for it in the
United States. Criminals now abound in the age groups 9-15.
Rapists are quite commonly as young as 10. Our social special-
ists, our teacher's unions, our churches say it is all due to a
faulty education system. Witness how test scores keep drop-
ping. The specialists bewail the fact that the United States now
ranks around 39th in the level of education in the world.
  Why do we bemoan what is so obvious? OUR EDUCATlON
SYSTEM WAS PROGRAMMED TO SELF-DESTRUCT.
THAT WAS WHAT DR. ALEXANDER KING WAS SENT
HERE BY NATO TO ARRANGE. THAT IS WHAT JUSTICE
HUGO BLACK WAS ORDERED TO ARRANGE. THE FACT
IS, THE COMMITTEE OF 300, WITH THE APPROVAL OF
OUR GOVERNMENT, DOES NOT WANT OUR YOUTH TO

                              85

BE PROPERLY EDUCATED. The education that Freemason
Justice Hugo Black, Alexander King, Gunnar Myrdal and his
wife  came  to  give  the  children of the United States is that
CRIME PAYS, EXPEDIENCY IS WHAT COUNTS.
   They taught our children that United States law is unequally
applied, and that is perfectly in order. Our children were properly
educated by a decade of corrupt examples; Ronald Reagan and
George Bush were ruled by greed and became totally corrupted
by it. Our education system hasn't failed. Under the guidance of
King, Black and the Myrdals it is actually a great success, but it
all depends from whose point of view we look at it. The Com-
mittee of 300 is DELIGHTED with our education system, and
will not allow one comma of it to be changed.
   According to Stanford and Willis Harmon, the induced trauma
of long range penetration of which our education is a part, has
been going on for 45 years, yet how many are aware of the
insidious pressures being applied to our society and the constant
exposure to brainwashing that goes on every day? The mysterious
gang wars that broke out in New York in the 1950's is an
example of how the conspirators can create and stage-manage
any type of disruptive elements they like. Where those gang
wars came from nobody knew until the 1980's when researchers
uncovered the  hidden controllers who directed the so-called
"social phenomena."
   Gang wars were carefully planned at Stanford, deliberately
designed to shock society and cause ripples of disturbances. By
1958 there were in excess of 200 of these gangs. They were
made popular by a musical and a Hollywood movie, "West Side
Story." After making the news for a decade, suddenly, in 1966,
they disappeared off the streets of New York, Los Angeles
New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Chicago.
   Throughout the near decade of gang violence, the public
reacted according to the profiled response Stanford expected;
society as a whole could not comprehend gang warfare and the
public  responded in a maladaptive manner.  Had there been

                              86

those wise enough to recognize in gang wars a Stanford experi-
ment in social engineering and brainwashing, the conspirator's
plot would have been exposed. Either we did not have trained
specialists who could see what was going on--which is highly
unlikely--or else they were threatened and remained silent. The
cooperation with Stanford by the news media brought to light a
"new age" attack on our environment just as predicted by the
social engineers and new-science scientists at Tavistock.
   In 1989 gang warfare, as a social conditioning to change,
was reintroduced to the streets of Los Angeles. Within a few
short months of the first incidents, gangs began to proliferate--
first in the scores, then in the hundreds on the streets of the East
Side of Los Angeles. Crack houses and rampant prostitution
proliferated; drug dealers dominated the streets. Anybody who
got in their way was gunned down. The outcry in the press was
loud and long. Stanford's targeted large population group began
defending itself with slogans. This is what Tavistock called the
first phase, with the targeted group failing to identify the source
of the crisis.
   The second phase of the gang war crisis was "fragmentation."
People not living in the areas frequented by gangs said, "Thank
God they are not in our neighborhood." This ignored the fact
that the crisis continued with or without recognition and that
social  order  in Los  Angeles  had begun to break  down.  As
profiled by Tavistock, those groups not affected by gang war
"broke away to defend themselves" because the source of the
crisis was not identified, the so called "maladaptation" process
the period of disassociation.
   Apart from the proliferation of drug sales, what is the purpose
of gang wars? First, it is to show the targeted group that they are
not safe, i.e., insecurity is generated. Secondly, it is to show that
organized society is helpless in the face of such violence and
thirdly  to bring about a recognition of the fact that our social
order is collapsing. The present wave of gang violence will go
away just as quickly as it started, once the three phases of the

                              87

Stanford program are completed.
   An outstanding example of social conditioning to  accept
change, even when it is recognized as unwelcome change by the
large population group in the sights of Stanford Research Insti-
tute,  was  the  "advent" of the BEATLES.  The Beatles  were
brought to the United States as part of a social experiment which
would subject large population groups to brainwashing of which
they were not even aware.
   When Tavistock brought the Beatles to the United States
nobody could have imagined the cultural disaster that was to
follow in their wake. The Beatles were an integral part of "THE
AQUARIAN CONSPIRACY," a living organism which sprang
From "THE CHANGING IMAGES OF MAN," URH (489)-
2150-Policy Research Report No. 4/4/74. Policy Report pre-
pared by SRI Center for the study of Social Policy, Director,
Professor Willis Harmon.
   The  phenomenon of the  Beatles  was  not a  spontaneous
rebellion by youth against the old social system. Instead it was a
carefully  crafted  plot  to  introduce  by a conspiratorial body
which could not be identified, a highly destructive and divisive
element into a large population group targeted for change against
its will. New words and new phrases--prepared by Tavistock--
were introduced to America along with the Beatles. Words such
as "rock" in relation to music sounds, "teenager," "cool," "dis-
covered"  and "pop music" were a lexicon of disguised code
words signifying the acceptance of drugs and arrived with and
accompanied the Beatles wherever they went, to be "discovered"
by  "teenagers."  Incidentally, the word "teenagers"  was  never
used until just before the Beatles arrived on the scene, courtesy
of the Tavistock Institute for Human Relations.
   As in the case of gang wars, nothing could or would have
been accomplished without the cooperation of the media, espe-
cially the electronic media and, in particular, the scurrilous Ed
Sullivan who had been coached by the conspirators as to the role
he was to play. Nobody would have paid much attention to the

                              88

motley crew from Liverpool and the 12-atonal system of "music"
that was to follow had it not been for an overabundance of press
exposure. The  12-atonal system consisted of heavy, repetitive
sounds, taken from the music of the cult of Dionysus and the
Baal priesthood by Adorno and given a "modern" flavor by this
special friend of the Queen of England and hence the Committee
of 300.
   Tavistock and its Stanford Research Center created trigger
words which then came into general usage around "rock music"
and its fans. Trigger words created a distinct new break-away
largely young population group which was persuaded by social
engineering and conditioning to believe that the Beatles really
were  their  favorite  group. All trigger words devised in the
context of "rock music" were designed for mass control of the
new targeted group, the youth of America.
   The Beatles did a perfect job, or perhaps it would be more
correct to say that Tavistock and Stanford did a perfect job, the
Beatles merely reacting like trained robots "with a little help
from their friends"--code words for using drugs and making it
"cool." The Beatles became a highly visible "new type"--more
Tavistock jargon--and as such it was not long before the group
made  new  styles  (fads  in  clothing,  hairstyles  and  language
usage) which upset the older generation, as was intended. This
was part of the "fragmentation-maladaptation" process worked
out by  Willis  Harmon  and his  team  of social  scientists  and
genetic engineering tinkerers and put into action.
   The role of the print and electronic media in our society is
crucial to the success of brainwashing large population groups.
Gang wars ended in Los Angeles in 1966 as the media withdrew
its coverage. The same thing will happen with the current wave
of gang wars in Los Angeles. Street gangs will wither on the
vine once media saturation coverage is toned down and then
completely withdrawn. As in  1966, the issue would become
"burned out." Street gangs will have served their purpose of
creating turbulence and insecurity. Exactly the same pattern will

                              89

be followed in the case of "rock" music. Deprived of media
attention, it will eventually take its place in history.
   Following the Beatles, who incidentally were put together
by the Tavistock Institute, came other "Made in England" rock
groups, who, like the Beatles, had Theo Adorno write their cult
lyrics and compose all the "music." I hate to use these beautiful
words in the context of "Beatlemania"; it reminds me of how
wrongly the word "lover" is used when referring to the filthy
interaction between two homosexuals writhing in pigswill. To
call "rock" music, is an insult, likewise the language used in
"rock lyrics."
   Tavistock  and  Stanford Research  then  embarked on  the
second phase of the work commissioned by the Committee of
300. This new phase turned up the heat for social change in
America. As quickly as the Beatles had appeared on the American
scene, so too did the "beat generation," trigger words designed
to separate and fragment society. The media now focused its
attention on the "beat generation." Other Tavistock-coined words
came seemingly out of nowhere: "beatniks," "hippies," "flower
children" became part of the vocabulary of America. It became
popular to "drop out" and wear dirty jeans, go about with long
unwashed hair. The "beat generation" cut itself off from main-
stream America. They became just as infamous as the cleaner
Beatles before them.
    The newly-created group and its "lifestyle" swept millions
of young Americans into the cult. American youth underwent a
radical revolution without ever being aware of it, while the older
generation stood by helplessly, unable to identify the source of
the crisis, and thus reacting in a maladaptive manner against its
manifestation, which were drugs of all types, marijuana, and
later Lysergic acid, "LSD," so conveniently provided for them
by the Swiss pharmaceutical company, SANDOZ, following the
discovery by one of its chemists, Albert Hoffman, how to make
synthetic  ergotamine,  a  powerful  mind-altering  drug. The
Committee of 300 financed the project through one of their

                              90

banks, S. C. Warburg, and the drug was carried to America by
the philosopher, Aldous Huxley.
   The new "wonder drug" was promptly distributed in "sample"
size packages, handed out free of charge on college campuses
across the United States and at "rock" concerts, which became the
leading vehicle for proliferating the use of drugs. The question
that cries out for an answer is, what was the Drug Enforcement
Agency (DEA) doing at the time? There is compelling circum-
stantial evidence that would appear to indicate that the DEA knew
what was going on but was ordered not to take any action.
    With very substantial numbers of new British "rock" bands
arriving in the U.S., rock concerts began to become a fixture on
the social calender of American youth. In tandem with these
"concerts," the use of drugs among the youth rose in proportion.
The devilish bedlam of discordant heavy beat sounds numbed
the minds of listeners so that they were easily persuaded to try
the new drug on the basis that "everybody is doing it." Peer
pressure is a very strong weapon. The "new culture" received
maximum coverage from the jackal media, which cost the con-
spirators not one single thin dime.
   Great  anger  was  felt by  a  number of civic  leaders  and
churchmen over the new cult but their energies were misdirected
against the RESULT of what was going on and not against the
CAUSE. Critics of the rock cult made the same mistakes that had
been made in the prohibition era, they criticized law enforce-
ment agencies, teachers, parents   anybody but the conspirators.
   Because of the anger and resentment I feel toward the great
drug plague, I make no apology for using language which is not
customary for me to use. One of the worst drug slobs ever to
walk the streets of America was Alan Ginsberg. This Ginsberg
pushed the use of LSD through advertising which cost him
nothing, although under normal circumstances it would have
cost millions of dollars in TV advertising revenues. This free
advertising for drugs, and LSD in particular, reached a new high
in the late 1960's, thanks to the ever-willing cooperation of the

                              91

media. The effect of Ginsberg's mass advertising campaign was
devastating; the American public was subjected to one cultural
future shock after another in rapid succession.
   We became over-exposed and over stimulated and, again,
may I remind you that this is Tavistock jargon, lifted from the
Tavistock training manual, overwhelmed by its new develop-
ment and, when we reached that point, our minds began to lapse
into apathy; it was just too much to cope with, that is to say,
"long range penetration had taken hold of us." Ginsberg claimed
to be a poet but no greater rubbish was ever written by anyone
who ever aspired to becoming a poet. Ginsberg's designated
task had little to do with poetry; his main function was to push
the new subculture and force acceptance of it upon the large
targeted population group.
    To assist him in his task, Ginsberg coopted the services of
Norman Mailer, a writer of sorts who had spent some time in a
mental institution. Mailer was a favorite of the leftwing Holly-
wood crowd and so had no problem with getting maximum
television time for Ginsberg. Naturally Mailer had to have a
pretext--not even he could blatantly come out with the true
nature of Ginsberg's television appearances. So a charade was
adopted: Mailer would talk "seriously" on camera with Ginsberg
about poetry and literature.
   This method of getting wide television coverage at no cost
to themselves was followed by every rock group and concert
promoter who followed the example set by Ginsberg. The elec-
tronic media moguls had big hearts when it came to giving free
time to these dirty verminous creatures and their even dirtier
products and filthy ideas. Their promotion of horrible garbage
spoke volumes and, without abundant help from the print and
electronic media, the drug trade could not have spread as rapidly
as it did in the late 1960's-early 197O's, and probably would
have been confined to a few small local areas.
    Ginsberg was able to give several nationally televised per-
formances extolling the virtues of LSD and marijuana, under

                              92

the guise of "new ideas" and "new cultures" developing in the
art and music world. Not to be outdone by the electronic media,
Ginsberg's admirers wrote glowing articles about "this colorful
man" in the art and social columns of all of America,s largest
newspapers and magazines. There had never been such an across-
the-media-board free  advertising  campaign  in  the  history of
newspaper, radio and television and it cost the promoters of the
Aquarian conspiracy, NATO and the Club of Rome not one red
cent. It was all absolutely free advertising for LSD, only thinly
disguised as "art" and "culture."
   One of Ginsberg's closest friends, Kenny Love, published a
Five-page report in the New York Times. This is in accordance
with  the  methodology  used by  Tavistock and  Stanford Re-
search: If something is to be promoted which the public has not
yet been fully brainwashed to accept, then have someone write
an article, covering all sides of the subject matter. The other
method is to have live television talk shows in which a panel of
experts promotes the product and or idea under the pretext of
"discussing", it. There are point and counter-point, both pro and
con participants airing their support or opposition. When it is all
over, the subject to be promoted has been dinned into the public
mind.  While  this  was  new in  the  early 1970's, today it is
standard practice on which talk shows thrive.
   Love's Five-page pro LSD pro Ginsberg article was duly
printed by the New York Times. Had Ginsberg tried to buy the
same amount of space in an advertisement, it would have cost
him at least $50,000. But Ginsberg didn't have to worry; thanks
to his Friend Kenny Love, Ginsberg got the massive advertising
all for free. With newspapers like the New York Times and the
Washington Post under the control of the Committee of 300, this
kind of free advertising is given to any subject matter, and more
especially to those promoting decadent life styles--drugs-hedo-
nism--anything that will confuse the American people. After
the trial run with Ginsberg and LSD, it became standard Club of
Rome practice to call upon major newspapers in America to

                              93

give free advertising on demand to people and ideas they were
promoting.
   Worse yet--or better yet, depending upon the viewpoint--
United Press (UP) picked up Kenny Love's free advertising for
Ginsberg and LSD and telexed it to HUNDREDS of newspa-
pers and magazines around the country under the guise of a
"news"  story.  Even  such  highly  respectable  establishment
magazines as "Harpers Bazaar" and "TIME" made Mr. Ginsberg
respectable. If a nation-wide campaign of this magnitude were
presented to Ginsberg and the promoters of LSD by an advertising
agency, the price tag would have run into at least $1 million in
terms of 1970 dollars. Today the price tag would be nothing less
than $15-$16 million dollars. It is no wonder that I refer to the
news media as "jackals."
   I suggest that we try to find any media outlet to do an expose
on the Federal Reserve Board, which is what I did. I took my
article,  which was  a good expose of the greatest swindle on
earth, to every major newspaper, radio and television station,
magazine  house  and  several talk-show  hosts. A few  made
promises  that  sounded  good--they  would  definitely  air  the
article and have me discuss it--give them about a week and they
would get back to me. Not one of them ever did, nor did my
article ever appear in the pages of their newspapers and journals.
It was as if a blanket of silence had been thrown over me and the
subject  I  was  endeavoring to promote,  and indeed that was
precisely what had happened.
   Without massive media hype, and without almost around
the clock coverage, the hippy-beatnik rock, drug cult would
never have gotten off the ground; it would have remained a
localized oddity. The Beatles, with their twanging guitars, silly
expressions, drug language and weird clothes, would not have
amounted to a hill of beans. Instead, because the Beatles were
given saturation coverage by the media, the United States has
suffered one cultural shock after another.
   The men buried in the think tanks and research institutions,

                              94

whose names and faces are still not known to but a few people,
made sure that the press played its part. Conversely, the media's
important role  in  not exposing  the  power behind  the  future
cultural shocks made certain that the source of the crisis was
never identified.  Thus  was  our society  driven  mad  through
psychological shocks and stress. "Driven mad" is taken from
Tavistock's  training manual. From its modest beginnings  in
1921, Tavistock was ready in 1966 to launch a major irrevers-
ible cultural revolution in America, which has not yet ended.
The Aquarian Conspiracy is part of it.
   Thus softened up, our nation was now deemed ripe for the
introduction of drugs which was to rival the prohibition era in
scope and the huge amounts of money to be made. This too was
an integral part of the Aquarian Conspiracy. The proliferation of
drug usage was one of the subjects under study at the Science
Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at Tavistock's Sussex University
facility. It was known as the "future shocks" center, a title given
to so-called future oriented psychology designed to manipulate
whole population groups to induce "future shocks." It was the
first of several such institutions set up by Tavistock.
    "Future  shocks"  is  described  as  a series  of events  which
come so fast that the human brain cannot absorb the information.
As I said earlier, science has shown that there are clearly marked
limits to the amount of changes and the nature of them that the
mind can deal with. After continuous shocks, the large targeted
population group discovers that it does not want to make choices
any more. Apathy takes over, often preceded by mindless violence
such as is characteristic of the Los Angeles street gangs, serial
killers, rapists and child kidnapers.
   Such a group becomes easy to control and will docilely
follow  orders  without rebelling,  which is the object of the
exercise. "Future shocks," says SPRU, "is defined as physical
and psychological distress arising from the excess load on the
decision-making mechanism of the  human mind."  That  is
Tavistock jargon lifted straight from Tavistock manuals--which

                              95

they don't know I have.
   Just as an overloaded electrical circuit will activate a trip
switch, so do humans "trip  out," which is a syndrome that
medical science is only now beginning to understand, although
John Rawlings Reese conducted experiments in this field as far
back as the 1920's. As can be appreciated, such a targeted group
is ready to "trip out" and take to drugs as a means of escape from
the pressures of so many choices having to be made. This is how
Drug  usage  was  spread  so  rapidly  through America's "beat
generation." What started with the Beatles and sample packages
of LSD has grown into a flood-tide of drug usage which is
swamping America.
   The drug trade is controlled by the Committee of 300 from
the Top down. The drug trade started with the British East India
Company and was closely followed by the Dutch East India
Company. Both were controlled by a "Council of 300." The list
of names of members and stockholders of the BEIC read like
something out of Debretts Peerage. BEIC established the "China
Inland Mission," whose job it was to get The Chinese peasants,
or coolies, as they were called, addicted to opium. This created
the market for opium which the BEIC then filled.
   In much the same way the Committee of 300 used "The
"Beatles" to popularize "social drugs" with the youth of America
and The Hollywood "in-crowd." Ed Sullivan was sent to England
To become acquainted with The first Tavistock Institute "rock
group"  to  hit the  shores  of the United States. Sullivan then
returned to the United States to draft the strategy for the electronic
media on how to package and sell the group. Without the full
cooperation of the electronic media and Ed Sullivan, in particular,
"The Beatles" and their "music" would have died on the vine.
Instead, our national life and the character of the United States
was forever changed.
   Now that we know, it is all too clear how successful the
"Beatles" campaign to proliferate the use of drugs became. The
fact that "The Beatles" had their music and lyrics written for

                              96

them by Theo Adorno was concealed from public view. The
prime function to "The Beatles" was to be discovered by teen-
agers,  who  where  then  subjected  to  a non-stop  barrage of
"Beatle music," until they became convinced that they liked the
sound and adopted it, along with all that accompanied it. The
Liverpool group performed up to expectations, and with "a little
help from their friends," i.e., illegal substances we call drugs
created a whole new class to young Americans in the precise
mold ordained by the Tavistock Institute.
    Tavistock had created a highly visible "new type" to act as
their drug-runners. The China Inland Mission "Christian mis-
sionaries" would not have fitted in with the 1960's. "New type"
is  social-science scientist jargon;  what it meant was that the
Beatles created new social patterns, first and foremost being to
normalize and popularize the use of drugs, new tastes in clothes
and hair styles which really distinguished them from the older
generation as was intended by Tavistock.
   It is important to note the deliberate fragmentation-inducing
language used by Tavistock. The "teenagers" never once dreamed
that all the "different" things they aspired to were the product
of older scientists working in think tanks in England and Stanford
Research. How mortified they would have been if they had
discovered that most of their "cool" habits and expressions were
deliberately created for their use by a group of older social
science scientists!
   The role of the media was, and remains, very important in
promoting the use of drugs on a nation-wide scale. When cov-
erage of the street warfare gangs was abruptly terminated by the
media, they became "burned out" as a social phenomena; the
"new age" of drugs followed. The media has always served as a
catalyst and has always pushed "new causes" and now media
attention  was focused on drug usage and its  supporters, the
"beat generation," yet another phrase fashioned at Tavistock, in
its  determined efforts  to bring  about social  changes  in The
United States.

                              97

   Drug usage now became an accepted part of everyday life in
America. This Tavistock-designed program took in millions of
American youth, and the older generation began to believe that
America was undergoing a natural social revolution, failing all
the while to realize that what was happening to their children
was not a spontaneous movement, but a highly artificial creation
designed to force changes in America's social and political life.
   The descendants of the British East India Company were
delighted with the success of their drug pushing program. Their
disciples became adept in the use of lysergic acid (LSD)  so
conveniently made available by patrons of the drug trade like
Aldous Huxley, courtesy of the highly respected Sandoz company
of Switzerland  and financed by the great Warburg banking
dynasty. The new "wonder drug" was promptly distributed at all
rock concerts and on college campuses in free sample packages.
The question that begs to be asked is, "What was the FBI doing
while all this was going on?"
   The purpose of the Beatles had become abundantly clear.
The British East India Company's descendants in the upper-
class  society in London must have felt very good about the
billions of dollars that began rolling in. With the coming of
"rock" which shall henceforth be used as shorthand to describe
Adorno's fiendish satanic music, a tremendous increase in the
use of social drugs, especially marijuana, was observed. The
entire dope business was expanded under the control and direction
of the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU).
   SPRU was run by Leland Bradford, Kenneth Damm and
Ronald Lippert, under whose expert guidance a large number of
new-science scientists were trained to promote "future shocks,"
one of the chief being the dramatic increase in the use of drugs
by America's teenagers. SPRU's policy papers, planted in vari-
ous  government  agencies,  including  the  Drug  Enforcement
Agency (DEA), dictated the course of the disastrous "drug war"
allegedly waged by the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
   This was the forerunner of how the United States is run

                              98
                 
today,  by one committee and/or council after another, by an
inner-government fed on Tavistock papers which they firmly
believe  are their own opinions. These virtual unknowns  are
making decisions that will forever change our form of govern-
ment and the quality of life here in the United States. Through
"crisis adaptation" we have already been changed so much as to
barely compare with what we were in the  1950's. Also, our
environment has been changed.
   There is much talk about environment these days and, while
it mostly refers to green surroundings, pure rivers and fresh air,
there is another, equally important environment,  namely, the
drug environment. The environment of our life style has become
polluted; our thinking has become polluted. Our ability to con-
trol our destiny has become polluted. We are confronted by
changes that pollute our thinking to the extent that we do not
know what to make of it all. The "Environment of Change" is
crippling the nation; we appear to have so little control that it
has produced anxiety and confusion.
   We now look to group solutions instead of individual solu-
tions to our problems. We do not make use of our own resources
to solve problems. In this the prolific rise in drug usage is playing
a leading role. The strategy is a deliberate one, devised by the
new-science scientists, the social engineers and tinkerers, aimed
at the most vulnerable of all areas, our self-image, or how we
perceive ourselves, which leads us eventually to become like
sheep being led to the slaughter. We have become confused by the
many choices we have to make, and we have become apathetic.
  We  are  manipulated by  unscrupulous  men  without  ever
being aware of it. This is particularly true of the drug trade and
we are now in the transition stage where we can be set up for a
change  from the present constitutional  form of government,
which has taken a giant step forward under the Bush administra-
tion. While there are those who still persist, in the face of all of
the  evidence  to  the  contrary  in  saying,  "It can't happen in
America," the fact is: IT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED. Our

                              99

will to resist events not to our liking has been steadily eroded
and undermined. We will resist, some of us say, but not so many
of us will do that, and we will be in the minority.
   The drug trade has insidiously changed our environment.
The  alleged  "war on  drugs"  is  a farce; it does not exist in
qualitative measure to make the slightest difference to the de-
scendants of the British East India Company. Combined with
computerization, we are almost fully brainwashed, robbed of
our ability to resist forced changes. Which brings us to another
environment, PEOPLE CONTROL, also known as personal
information control, without which governments cannot play
their numbers game.
   As matters stand, we the people have absolutely no way of
knowing just what government does or does not know about us.
Government computer files are not subject to scrutiny by the public
at  large.  Do  we  foolishly  believe  that personal  information
sacrosanct? Remember, in every society there are rich and power-
ful families who control law enforcement agencies. I have proved
the existence of such families. Do not think that if these families
wanted to find out about us, they could not do so. These are the
families who often have a member in the Committee of 300.
   Take Kissinger, for instance, who has his own private dos-
siers on hundreds of thousands of people, not only in the U.S.
but all over the world. Are we on Kissinger's enemy list? Is this
far fetched? Not at all. Take P2 Masonic and Committee Monte
Carlo who have such lists which run into tens of thousands of
names. Incidentally, Kissinger is one of them. There are other
"private" intelligence agencies, such as INTEL, whom we shall
meet later.
   One of the ways heroin is moved into Europe is through the
Principality of Monaco. The heroin comes from Corsica carried
in ferries that ply a busy trade between Corsica and Monte Carlo
during the summer. There is no check of what goes on or comes
off these ferries. As  there  is  no border between France  and
Monaco, drugs, and more especially heroin (partly processed

                              100

opium), flows through the open border of Monaco into laborato-
ries  in  France, or else if it has already been processed into
heroin, it goes directly to the distributors.
   The Grimaldi family has been in the drug smuggling busi-
ness for centuries. Because Prince Ranier got greedy and began
skimming heavily and would not desist after three warnings, his
wife, Princess Grace, was murdered in a car "accident." Ranier
underestimated the power of the Committee of which he is a
member. The Rover car in which she was traveling had the
brake fluid chambers tampered with in such a way that each
time the brakes were depressed, fluid was released in measured
amount, until by the time the car reached the most dangerous of
several hairpin bends, there was no stopping power, and it sailed
over  a  stone  wall, hitting the ground fifty feet below in a
sickening smash.
   Everything possible was  done by the Committee of 300
operatives to conceal the truth about the murder of Princess
Grace.  To this day the Rover car remains in the custody of
French police, shrouded under a cover on a trailer which no one
is allowed to approach, let alone examine. The signal for the
execution of Princess Grace was picked up by the British Army
listening post in Cyprus and it is believed by well placed source
that the Committee Monte Carlo and P2 gave the order.
   The drug trade, controlled by the Committee of 300, is a
crime against humanity, but having been conditioned and softened
up by years of incessant bombardment by Tavistock Institute,
we have more or less accepted our changed environment, re-
garding the drug trade as a problem that is "too big" to handle.
This is not the case. If we could marshal an entire nation, equip
and  send millions of American soldiers to fight in a war in
Europe in which he had no business intervening, if we could
defeat a major power, then we can smash the drug trade, using
the same WW II tactics.
   The  logistical problems that had to be  solved when we
entered the Second World War are even today still mind-boggling.

               INSTITUTIONS THROUGH WHICH

                  CONTROL IS EXERCISED
                        (Cont.)

Yet we  successfully overcame all problems.  Why then is it
impossible  to  defeat a  well-defined enemy,  far  smaller  and
weaker than Germany, given the immensely improved weapons
and surveillance equipment we have today? The real reason that
the drug problem is not eradicated is because it is being run by
the highest families in the entire world as part of a coordinated
gigantic money-making machine.
   In 1930, British capital invested in South America greatly
exceeded capital investment in British "dominions." Graham, an
authority on British investments abroad, stated that British in-
vestment in  South America "exceeded one trillion pounds."
Remember, this was 1930, and one trillion pounds was a stagger-
ing sum of money in those days. What was the reason for such
heavy investment in South America? In a word it was drugs.
   The  plutocracy  controlling  British  banks  held  the  purse
strings and then, as now, put up a most respectable facade to
cover their true business. No one ever caught them with dirtied
hands. They always had front men, even as they do today,
willing to take the blame if things went awry. Then as now the
connections with the drug trade were tenuous at best. No one
was ever able to lay  a finger on the respectable and "noble"
banking families of Britain, whose members are on the Com-
mittee of 300.
   There  is  great  significance  in that only  15  members  of
Parliament were the controllers of that vast empire, of which the
most prominent were Sir Charles Barry and the Chamberlain
family.  These  overlords  of finance  were busy  in places like
Argentina, Jamaica and Trinidad, which became big money-
spinners for them through the drug trade. In these countries,
British plutocrats kept "the locals" as they were contemptuously
called,  at bare  subsistence  levels,  hardly  above  slavery.  The
fortunes extracted from the drug trade in the Caribbean were vast.
   The plutocrats hid behind faces like Trinidad Leaseholds
Limited, but the REAL MEAT, then as now, was drugs. This is
true of today where we find that Jamaica's Gross National

                             102

Product (GNP) is made up almost entirely of sales of ganja, a
very potent form of marijuana. The mechanism for handling the
ganja trade was set up by David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger
under the title "Caribbean Basin Initiative."
   Up until a relatively short time ago, the true history of the
China opium trade was quite unknown, having been as well
covered up as it is possible to do. Many of my former students
in the days when I was lecturing, would come and ask me why
the Chinese were so fond of smoking opium? They were puzzled
as are many still today, over contradictory accounts of what had
actually taken place in China. Most thought it was merely a case
of the Chinese workers buying opium on an open market and
smoking it, or going to some of the thousands of opium dens and
forgetting their terrible existence for a while.
   The truth is that the supply of opium to China was a British
monopoly, an OFFICIAL monopoly of the British government
and  official  British policy.  The Indo-British opium trade in
China was one of the best kept secrets, around which many
misleading legends grew up, such as "Clive of India" and the
tales of derring-do by the British Army in India for the glory of
"the Empire," so well written by Rudyard Kipling, and tales of
"Tea Clippers" racing across the oceans with their cargoes of
China  tea  for the  high  society  drawing rooms  of Victorian
England. In reality, the history of British occupation of India
and Britain's Opium Wars are some of the most dastardly blots
on Western civilization.
   Almost 13% of the income of India under British rule was
derived from the sale of good quality Bengal opium to the
British-run opium distributors in China. "The Beatles" of the
day, the China Inland Mission, had done a great job in prolifer-
ating the use of opium among the poor Chinese laborers (coolies,
as they were called). These addicts did not suddenly materialize
out of thin air, any more than did teenager addicts in the U.S.
THE POINT TO REMEMBER IS THAT BOTH WERE CRE-
ATED. In China a market for opium was first created and then

                             103

filled by opium for Bengal. In the same way, a market for
marijuana and LSD was first created in the United States by
methods already described, and then filled by British plutocrats
and their American cousins with the help of the overlords of the
British banking establishment.
   The lucrative drug trade is one of the worst examples of
making money out of human misery; the other being the legal
drug  trade  run  by  the  pharmaceutical  drug  houses  under
Rockefeller ownership, in the U.S. for the most part, but with
substantial  companies  operating  in  Switzerland,  France  and
Britain and fully backed by the American Medical Association
(AMA). The dirty dope transactions and the money it generates
flows through the City of London, together with Hong Kong,
Dubai  and  latterly, Lebanon, thanks to the invasion of that
country by Israel.
   There will be those who doubt this statement. "Look at this
business columns of the Financial Times," they will tell us. "Don't
tell me that this is all related to drug money"? OF COURSE IT
IS, but don't imagine for one minute that the noble lords and
ladies of England are going to advertise the fact. Remember the
British East India Company? Officially, its business was trading
in tea!
    The London "Times" never dared tell the British public the
it was impossible to make VAST PROFITS from tea, nor did the
illustrious paper even hint at a trade in opium being plied by those
who spent their time in London's fashionable clubs or playing a
chukka of polo at the Royal Windsor Club, or that the gentlemen
officers who went out to India in the service of the Empire were
financed SOLELY by the enormous income derived from the
misery of the millions of Chinese coolies addicted to opium.
   The trade was conducted by the illustrious British East India
Company, whose meddling in political, religious and economic
affairs of the United States has cost us very dearly for over 200
years. The 300 members of the British East India Company's
board were a cut above the common herd. They were so mighty,

                             104

as Lord Bertrand Russell once observed, "They could even give
God advice when he had trouble in Heaven." Nor should we
imagine that anything has changed in the intervening years.
EXACTLY the same attitude prevails today among members of
the Committee of 300, which is why they often refer to them-
selves as the "Olympians."
   Later the British Crown, i.e., the Royal Family, joined the
British East India Company's trade, and used it as a vehicle to
produce opium in Bengal, and elsewhere in India, controlling
exports through what was called "transit duties," that is, the
Crown levied a tax on all producers of opium duly registered
with the state authority, who were sending their opium to China.
    Prior to 1896, when the trade was still "illegal"--a word
used to extract greater tribute from the producers of opium--
there never having been the slightest attempt to stop the trade,
colossal amounts of opium were shipped out of India on board
"China Tea Clippers," those sailing ships around which legend
and lore were built, which supposedly carried chests of tea from
India and China to the London exchanges.
   So audacious did the British East India Company lords and
ladies become that they tried to sell this lethal substance to the
Union and Confederate Armies in pill form as a pain killer. Is it
difficult to imagine just what would have happened had their
plan succeeded? All those hundreds of thousands of soldiers
would have left the battlefields totally hooked on opium. "The
Beatles" were much more successful in turning out millions of
teenage addicts in later years.
   The  Bengal  merchants  and  their  British  controllers  and
bankers grew fat and intolerant on the enormous amounts of
money  that poured into the coffers  of the British East India
Company from the wretched Chinese coolies opium trade. BEIC
profits, even in those years, far exceeded the combined profits
made in a single year by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler in
their heydays. The trend in making huge profits out of drugs was
carried over into the 1960's by such "legal" drug death mer-

                             105

chants as Sandoz, the makers of LSD and Hoffman la Roche,
manufacturers  of Valium.  The cost of the raw  material  and
manufacturing of Valium to Hoffman la Roche is $3 per kilo
(2.2 pounds). It is sold to their distributors for $20,000 per kilo.
By the time it reaches the consumer, the price of Valium has
risen to $50,000 per kilo. Valium is used in huge quantities in
Europe and the United States. It is possibly the most used drug
of its kind in the world.
   Hoffman la Roche does the same thing with Vitamin C,
which costs them less than 1 cent a kilo to produce. It is sold for
a profit of 10,000 percent. When a friend of mine blew the
whistle on this criminal company, which had entered into a
monopoly agreement with other producers, in contravention of
European Economic Community laws, he was arrested on the
Swiss-Italian  border  and  hustled  into prison; his wife  was
threatened by the Swiss police until she committed suicide. As a
British national he was rescued by the British consul in Berne as
soon as word of his plight was received, removed from prison
and flown out of the country. He lost his wife, his job and his
pension because he dared to disclose Hoffman La Roche secrets.
The Swiss take their Industrial Espionage law very seriously.
   Remember this the next time you see those lovely advertise-
ments of Swiss ski slopes, beautiful watches, pristine mountains
and cuckoo clocks. That is not what Switzerland is about. It is
about dirty multi-billion dollar money laundering which is car-
ried out by major Swiss banking houses. It is about the Committee
of  300   "legal"  drug  manufacturers.  Switzerland  is  the
Committee's ultimate "safe haven" for money and protection of
their bodies in time of global calamity.
   Now mind you, one could get into serious trouble with the
Swiss authorities for giving out any information on these ne-
farious activities. The Swiss regard it as "industrial espionage"
which  usually  carries  a 5-year term in prison.  It is  safer to
pretend that Switzerland is a nice clean country rather than look
under the covers or inside its garbage can banks.

                             106

    In 1931 the managing directors of the so-called "big Five"
British companies were rewarded by being made Peers of the
Realm for their activities in drug money laundering. Who decided
such matters and bestows such honors? It is the Queen of
England who bestows honors upon the men in the top positions
in the drug trade. British banks engaged in this terrible trade are
too numerous to mention, but a few of the top ones are:
       The British Bank of the Middle East.
       Midland Bank.
       National and Westminster Bank.
       Barclays Bank.
       Royal Bank of Canada.
       Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank.
       Baring Brothers Bank.
   Many of the merchant banks are up to their hocks in pigswill
drug trade profits, banks such as Hambros for example, run by
Sir Jocelyn Hambro. For a really interesting major study of the
Chinese opium trade, one would need access to India Office in
London. I was able to get in there because of my intelligence
service and received great assistance from the trustee of the
papers of the late Professor Frederick Wells Williamson, which
provided much information on the opium trade carried on by the
British East India Company in India and China in the 18th and
19th centuries. If only those papers could be made public, what a
storm would burst over the heads of the crowned vipers of Europe.
   Today the trade has shifted somewhat in that less expensive
cocaine has taken over a good part of the  North  American
market. In the 1960's the flood of heroin coming from Hong
Kong,  Lebanon  and  Dubai  threatened  to  engulf the  United
States and Western Europe. When demand outpaced supply
there was a switch to cocaine. But now, at the end of 1991, that
trend has been reversed; today it is heroin that is back in favor,
although it is true that cocaine still enjoys great favor among the
poorer classes.
   Heroin, we are told, is more satisfying to addicts; the effects

                             107

are far more intense and last longer than the effects of cocaine
and there is less international attention on heroin producers than
there is on Colombian cocaine shippers. Besides which, it is
hardly likely that the U.S. would make any real effort to stop the
production of opium in the Golden Triangle which is under the
control of the Chinese military, a serious war would erupt if any
country tried to interdict the trade. A serious attack on the opium
trade would bring Chinese military intervention.
   The British know this; they have no quarrel with China,
except for an occasional squabble over who gets the larger share
of the pie. Britain has been involved in the China opium trade
for over two centuries. No one is going to be so foolish as to
rock the boat when millions upon millions of dollars flow into
the bank accounts of the British oligarchists and more gold is
traded on the Hong Kong gold market than the combined total
traded in London and New York.
   Those individuals who fondly imagine they can do some
kind of a deal with a minor Chinese or Burmese overlord in the
hills of the Golden Triangle apparently have no idea of what is
involved.  If they had known, they would never have talked
about stopping the opium trade. Such talk reveals little knowl-
edge of the immensity and complexity of China's opium trade,
   British plutocrats, the Russian KGB, the CIA,  and U.S.
bankers are all in league with China. Could one man stop or
even make a small dent in the trade? It would be absurd to
imagine it. What is heroin and why is it favored over cocaine
these days? According to the noted authority on the subject
Professor Galen, heroin is a derivative of opium, a drug that
stupefies the senses and induces long periods of sleep. This is
what  most  addicts  like, it is called "being in the arms of
Morpheus." Opium is the most habit-forming drug known to
man.  Many pharmaceutical drugs contain opium in various
degrees, and it is believed that paper used in the manufacture of
cigarettes is first impregnated with opium, which is why smok-
ers become so addicted to their habit.

                             108

   The poppy seed from which it is derived was long known to
the Moguls of India, who used the seeds mixed in tea offered to
a difficult opponent. It is also used as a pain-killing drug which
largely  replaced  chloroform  and  other older anesthetics  of a
bygone era. Opium was popular in all of the fashionable clubs of
Victorian London and it was no secret that men like the Huxley
brothers used it extensively. Members of the Orphic-Dionysus
cults of Hellenic Greece and the Osiris-Horus cults of Ptolemaic
Egypt which Victorian society embraced, all smoked opium; it
was the "in" thing to do.
   So did some of those who met at St. Ermins Hotel in 1903 to
decide what sort of a world we would have. The descendants of
the St. Ermins crowd are found today in the Committee of 300.
It is these so-called world leaders who brought about such a
change in our environment that enabled drug usage to prolifer-
ate to the point where it can no longer be stopped by regular law
enforcement tactics and policies. This is especially true in big cities
where big populations can conceal a great deal of what transpires.
   Many in the circles of royalty were regular opium users. One
of their favorites was the writer Coudenhove-Kalergi who wrote
a book in 1932 entitled "REVOLUTION THROUGH TECH-
NOLOGY which was a blueprint for the return of the world to
a medieval society. The book, in fact, became a working paper for
the Committee of 300's plan to deindustrialize the world, starting
with the United States. Claiming that pressures of over-population
are a serious problem, Kalergi advised a return to what he called
"open spaces." Does this sound like the Khmer Rouge and Pol
Pot? Here are some extracts from the book:

        "In its facilities, the city of the future will resemble
   the city of the Middle Ages...and he who is not con-
   demned to live in a city because of his occupation, will
   go to the countryside. Our civilization is a culture of the
   major cities; therefore it is a marsh plant, born by de-
   generated, sickly and decadent people, who have vol-

                             109

   untarily,  or  involuntarily,  ended  up  in  this  dead-end
   street of life." Isn't that very close to what "AnkarWat"
   gave as "his" reasons for depopulating Phnom Penh?

   The first opium shipments reached England from Bengal in
1683, carried in British East India Company "Tea Clippers."
Opium was brought to England as a test, an experiment, to see
whether the common folk of England, the yeomen and the lower
classes, could be induced into taking the drug. It was what we
could call today "test marketing" of a new product. But the
sturdy  yeomen  and  the  much  derided  "lower  classes"  were
made of stern stuff, and the test marketing experiment was a
total flop. The "lower classes" of British society firmly rejected
opium smoking.
   The plutocrats and oligarchists in high society in London
began casting about for a market that would not be so resistant,
so unbending. They found such a market in China. In the papers
I studied at the India Office under the heading "Miscellaneous
Old Records," I found all the confirmation I could have wished
for in proving that the opium trade in China really took off
following the founding of the  British East India Company-
funded "China Inland Mission," ostensibly a Christian missionary
society but in reality the "promotion" men and women for the
new product being introduced into the market, that new product
being OPIUM.
   This was later confirmed when I was given access to the
papers of Sir George Birdwood in India Office records. Soon
after the China Inland Mission missionaries set out to give away
their sample packages  and show the coolies how to  smoke
opium, vast quantities of opium began to arrive in China. "The
Beatles" could not have done a better job. (In both cases the
trade was sanctioned by the British royal family, who openly
supported the Beatles.) Where the British East India Company
had failed in England, it now succeeded beyond its  wildest
expectations in China, whose teeming millions of poor looked

                             110

upon smoking opium as an escape from their life of misery.
    Opium dens began proliferating all across China, and in the
big cities like Shanghai and Canton, hundreds of thousands of
miserable Chinese found that a pipe of opium seemingly made
life bearable. The British East India Company had a clear run
for over a 100 years before the Chinese government woke up to
what was happening. It was only in  1729 that the first laws
against opium smoking were passed. The 300 board members of
BEIC did not like it one bit and, never one to back down, the
company was soon engaged in a running battle with the Chi-
nese government.
   The BEIC had developed poppy  seeds that brought the
finest quality opium from the poppy fields of Benares and Bihar
in the Ganges Basin in India, a country they fully controlled
this fetched top price, while the lower grades of opium from
other areas of India were sold for less. Not about to lose their
lucrative market, the British Crown engaged in running battles
with Chinese forces, and defeated them. In the same manner, the
U.S. government is supposedly fighting a running battle against
today's drug barons and, like the Chinese, are losing heavily.
There is however one big difference: The Chinese government
fought to win whereas the United States government is under no
compunction to win the battle which explains why staff turnover
n the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) is so high.
   Latterly, high grade quality opium has come out of Pakistan
via Makra on the desolate coastline of the country from whence
ships take the cargo to Dubai where it is exchanged for gold.
This is  said to account in part for heroin being favored over
cocaine today. The heroin trade is more discreet, there is no
murder of prominent officials such as became an almost daily
occurrence in Colombia. Pakistani opium does not sell for as
much as Golden Triangle or Golden Crescent (Iranian ) opium.
This has greatly spurred heroin production and sales which
threaten to overtake cocaine as the number one seller.
   The vile opium trade was talked about in the upper-crust

                             111

circles of English society for many years as "the spoils of the
Empire." The tall tales of valor in the Khyber Pass covered a
vast  trade  in  opium. The British Army was stationed in the
Khyber Pass to protect caravans carrying raw opium from being
pillaged by hill tribesmen. Did the British royal family know
this? They must have, what else would induce the Crown to
keep an army in this region where there was nothing of much
worth other than the lucrative opium trade? It was very expen-
sive to keep men under arms in a far away country. Her Majesty
must have asked why these military units were there? Certainly
not to play polo or billiards in the officers' mess.
   The BEIC was jealous of its monopoly in opium. Would-be
competitors received short shrift. In a noted trial in  1791, a
certain Warren Hastings was put on charges that he helped a
Friend to get into the opium trade at the expense of the BEIC.
The actual wording which I found in the records of the case
housed in India Office gives some insight into the vast opium
trade: "The charge is that Hastings has granted a contract for the
Provision of Opium for four years to Stephen Sullivan, without
advertising for the same, on terms glaringly obvious and wantonly
profuse, for the purpose of creating an INSTANT FORTUNE
for the said William Sullivan Esq." (Emphasis added.)
   As the BEIC-British government held the monopoly in opium
trading, the only people allowed to make instant fortunes were
the "nobility," the "aristocracy," the plutocrats and oligarchical
families  of England,  many  of whose descendants  sit on the
Committee of 300 just as their forbears sat on the Council of 300
who ran the  BEIC.  Outsiders  like Mr.  Sullivan  soon found
themselves in trouble with the Crown if they were so bold as to
try and help themselves get into the multi-billion pound Sterling
opium business.
   The honorable men of the BEIC with its list of 300 counselors
were members of all the famous gentlemen's clubs in London
and they were for the most part members of parliament, while
others, both in India and at home, were magistrates. Company

                             112

passports were required to land in China. When a few busybod-
ies arrived in China to investigate the British Crown's involve-
ment in the lucrative trade, BEIC magistrates promptly revoked
their passports, thus effectively denying them entry into China.
   Friction with the Chinese government was common. The
Chinese  had passed a law,  the  Yung  Cheny Edict of  1729,
forbidding the importation of opium, yet the BEIC managed to
keep opium as an entry in the Chinese Customs Tariff books
until 1753, the duty being three taels per chest of opium. Even
when British special secret service (the 007 of the day) saw to it
that troublesome Chinese officials were bought off, and in cases
where that was not possible, they were simply murdered.
   Every British monarch since 1729 has benefited immensely
from the drug trade and this holds good for the present occupant
of the throne. Their ministers saw to it that wealth flowed into
their family coffers. One such minister of Victoria's was Lord
Palmerston. He clung obstinately to the belief that nothing
should be allowed to stop Britain's opium trade with China.
Palmerston's plan was to supply the Chinese government with
enough opium to make individual members become  greedy.
Then the British would withhold supplies and when the Chinese
government was on its knees, supplies would be resumed--but
at a much higher price, thus retaining a monopoly through the
Chinese government itself, but the plan failed.
   The Chinese  government responded by destroying  large
cargoes of opium stored in warehouses, and British merchants
were required to sign INDIVIDUAL agreements not to import
any more opium into Canton. BEIC responded by sending scores
of fully-loaded  opium carrying ships to lie in the roads of
Macao. Companies beholden to BEIC, rather than individuals,
then sold these cargoes. Chinese Commissioner Lin said, "There
is so much opium on board English vessels now lying in the
roads of this place (Macao) which will never be returned to the
country from which it came, and I shall not be surprised to hear
of its being smuggled in under American colors." Lin's prophecy

                             113

proved to be remarkably accurate.
   The Opium Wars against China were designed to "put the
Chinese in their place" as Lord Palmerston once said, and the
British Army did that. There was simply no stopping the vast,
lucrative trade which provided the British oligarchical feudal
lords with untold billions, while leaving China with millions of
opium addicts. In later years the Chinese appealed to Britain for
help with their immense problem and received it.  Thereafter
respective Chinese governments realized the value in cooperat-
ing instead of fighting with Britain--and this held good during
the bloody rule of Mao Tse Tung--so that today, as I have
already mentioned, any quarrels that come about are only over
the share of the opium trade each is entitled to.
   To advance to more modern history, the Chinese-British
partnership was solidified by the Hong Kong agreement which
established an equal partnership in the opium trade. This has
proceeded smoothly, with an occasional ripple here and there, but
while violence and death, robbery and murder marked the pro-
gression of the Colombian cocaine trade, no such baseness was
allowed to disturb the heroin trade, which, as I said earlier, is once
again coming into the ascendancy as we near the end of 1991.
   The major problem that arose in Sino-British relations dur-
ing the past 60 years concerned China's demand for a larger
slice of the opium-heroin pie. This was settled when Britain
agreed to hand Hong Kong over to full Chinese government
control which will come into effect in 1997. Other than that, the
partners retain their former equal shares of the lucrative opium
trade based in Hong Kong.
   The British oligarchical families of the Committee of 300
who were entrenched in Canton at the height of the opium trade
left their descendants in position. Look at a list of prominent
British residents in China and you will see the names of members
of the Committee of 300 among them. The same holds good for
Hong Kong. These plutocrats of a feudal era, that they seek to
return to the world, control the gold and opium trade of which

                             114

Hong Kong is THE center. Burmese and Chinese opium poppy
growers get paid in gold; they do not trust the U.S. paper $100
bill. This explains the very large volume of gold trade in the
Hong Kong exchange.
   The Golden Triangle is no longer the largest producer of
opium. That dubious title has since 1987 been shared by the
Golden Crescent (Iran), Pakistan and Lebanon. These are the
principle opium producers, although smaller quantities are once
again coming out of Afghanistan and Turkey. The drug trade,
and more: especially the opium trade, could not function without
the help of banks as we shall demonstrate as we proceed.
   How do banks with their great air of respectability  fit into
the drug trade with all of its attendant filth? It is a very long and
complicated story, which could be the subject of a book on its
own. One way in which banks participate is by financing front
companies importing the chemicals needed to process raw opium
into heroin. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank with a branch
office in London is right in the middle of such trade through a
company called TEJAPAIBUL, which banks with Hong Kong and
Shanghai Bank. What does this company do? It imports into Hong
Kong most of the chemicals needed in the heroin refining process.
   It is also a major supplier of acetic anhydride For the Golden
Crescent and the Golden Triangle, Pakistan, Turkey and Leba-
non. The actual financing for this trading is hived off to the
Bangkok  Metropolitan  Bank.  Thus, the secondary activities
connected with processing opium, while not in the same cat-
egory us the opium trade, nevertheless  generates substantial
income for banks. But the real income of the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Bank and indeed all banks in the region is financing
the actual opium trade.
   It took a lot of research on my part to link the price of gold to
the price of opium. I used to tell anyone who would listen, "If
you want to know the price of gold find out what the price of a
pound or a kilo of opium is in Hong Kong." To my critics I
answered, "Take a look at what happened in 1977, a critical year

                             115

for gold." The Bank of China shocked the gold pundits, and
those clever forecasters who are to be found in great numbers in
America, by suddenly and without warning, dumping 80 tons of
gold on the market.
   That depressed the price of gold in a big hurry. All the experts
could say was, "We never knew China had that much gold
where could it have come from?" It came from the gold which is
paid to China in the Hong Kong Gold Market for large purchases
of opium. The current policy of the Chinese government toward
England is the same as it was in the 18th and 19th centuries. The
Chinese economy, tied to the economy of Hong Kong--and I
don't mean  television sets, textiles, radios, watches, pirated
cassette and video tapes--I mean opium/heroin--would take a
terrible beating if it were not for the opium trade it shares with
Britain. The BEIC is gone but the descendants of the Council of
300 linger on in the membership of the Committee of 300.
   The oldest of the oligarchical British families  who  were
leaders in the opium trade for the past 200 years are still in it
today. Take the Mathesons, for instance. This "noble" family is
one of the pillars of the opium trade. When things looked a bit
shaky a few years ago, the Mathesons stepped in and gave China
a loan of $300 million for real estate investment. Actually it was
billed  as  a  "joint venture between  the People's Republic of
China and the Matheson Bank." When researching India Office
papers of the 1700's I came across the name of Matheson, and it
kept on cropping up everywhere--London, Peking, Dubai, Hong
Kong, wherever heroin and opium are mentioned.
   The problem with the drug trade is that it has become a threat
to national sovereignty. Here is what the Venezuelan Ambassa-
dor to the United Nations said about this world-wide threat:

   "The problem of drugs bas already ceased to be dealt
   with simply as one of public health or a social problem.
   It has turned into something far more serious and far-
   reaching which affects our national sovereignty; a prob-

                             116

    lem of national security, because it strikes at the indepen-
    dence of a nation. Drugs in all their manifestations of
    production,  commercialization  and  consumption,  de-
    naturalizes us by injuring our ethical, religious and politi-
    cal life, our historic, economic, and republican values."

    This is precisely the way the Bank of International Settle-
ments and the IMF are operating. Let me say without hesitation
that both these banks are nothing more than bully-boy clearing
houses for the drug trade. The BIS undermines any country that
the IMF wants to sink by setting up ways and means for the easy
outflow of flight capital. Nor does BIS recognize nor make any
distinction when it comes down to what is flight capital and
what is laundered drug money.
   The BIS operates on gangster lines. If a country will not
submit to asset-stripping by the IMF, then it says in effect, "Right,
then we will break you by means of the huge cache of narco-dollars
we are holding." It is easy to understand why gold was demonetized
and  substituted with the paper "dollar"  as  the  world's  reserve
currency. It is not as easy to blackmail a country holding gold
reserves as it is one having its reserves in paper dollars.
   The IMF held a meeting in Hong Kong a few years ago
which was attended by a colleague of mine and he told me the
seminar dealt with this very question. He informed me that the
IMF agents told the meeting that they could literally cause a run
on any country's currency, using narco-dollars, which would
precipitate a flight of capital. Rainer-Gut, a Credit Suisse del-
egate and member of the Committee of 300, said he foresaw a
situation where national credit and national financing would be
under one  umbrella organization by the turn of the century.
While Rainer-Gut did not spell it out, everybody at the seminar
knew exactly what he was talking about.
   From Colombia to Miami, from the Golden Triangle to the
Golden Gate, from Hong Kong to New York, from Bogota to
Frankfurt, the drug trade, and more especially the heroin trade,

                             117

is BIG BUSINESS and it is run from the top down by some of
the most "untouchable" families in the world, and each of those
families have at least one member who is on the Committee of
300. It is not a street corner business, and it takes a great deal of
money and expertise to keep it flowing smoothly. The machin-
ery under control of the Committee of 300 ensures this.
   Such talents are not found on the street corners and subways
of New York. To be sure the pushers and peddlers are an integral
part of the trade, but only as very small part-time salesmen. I say
part-time because they are caught and rivalry gets some of them
shot. But what does that matter? There are plenty of replace-
ments available.
   No,  it is not anything the Small Business Administration
would be interested in. IT IS BIG BUSINESS, a vast empire,
this dirty drug business. Of necessity, it is operated from the top
down  in every  single country in the world.  It is, in fact, the
largest single enterprise in the world today,  transcending all
others. That it is protected from the top down is borne out by the
fact that, like international terrorism, it cannot be stamped out
which should indicate to a reasonable person that some of this
biggest names in royal circles, the oligarchy, the plutocracy are
running it, even if it is done through intermediaries.
   The main countries involved in growing poppies and the
cocoa bush are Burma, Northern China, Afghanistan, Iran, Pa-
Kistan, Thailand, Lebanon, Turkey, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia. Co-
lombia does not grow the cocoa bush but, next to Bolivia, is the
main refiner of cocaine and the chief financial center of the
cocaine trade which, since General Noriega was kidnaped and
imprisoned by President Bush, is being challenged by Panama
for first place in money laundering and capital financing of the
cocaine trade.
  The heroin trade is financed by Hong Kong banks, London
banks and some Middle East banks such as the British Bank of
the Middle East. Lebanon is fast becoming the "Switzerland of
the Middle East." Countries involved in the distribution and

                             118

routing of heroin are Hong Kong, Turkey, Bulgaria, Italy, Mo-
naco, France (Corsica and Marseilles) Lebanon and Pakistan.
The United States is the largest consumer of narcotics,  first
place going to cocaine, which is being challenged by heroin.
Western Europe and Southwest Asian countries are the biggest
users of heroin. Iran has a huge heroin addict population--in
excess of 2 million as of 1991.
   There is not a single government that does not know pre-
cisely  what is going on  with regard to the drug trade, but
individual members holding powerful positions are taken, but
of by the Committee of 300 through its world-wide network of
subsidiaries. If any government member is "difficult," he or she
is removed, as in the case of Pakistan's Ali Bhutto and Italy's
Aldo Moro. No one is beyond the reach of this all-powerful
Committee, even though Malaysia has been successful in hold-
ing out up until now. Malaysia has the strictest anti-drug laws in
the world. Possession of even small amounts is punishable by
the death penalty.
   Like the Kintex Company of Bulgaria, most smaller coun-
tries have a direct hand in these criminal enterprises.  Kintex
trucks regularly ferried heroin through Western Europe in its
own  fleet  of trucks  bearing  the  EEC  marker Triangle
Internationale Routier (TIR). Trucks bearing this marker and the
EEC recognition number are not supposed to be stopped at
customs  boarder posts. TlR trucks  are  allowed to carry  only
perishable  items.  They  are  supposed  to be inspected in the
country from whence they originated and documentation to this
effect is supposed to be carried by each truck driver.
   Under international treaty obligations this is what happens,
thus Kintex trucks were able load their cargoes of heroin and
certify it as "fresh fruit and vegetables;" and then make their
way through Western Europe, even entering high-security NATO
bases in Northern Italy. In this manner, Bulgaria became one of
the principal countries through which heroin was routed.
   The  only  way to  stop the huge  amounts  of heroin  and

                             119

cocaine presently finding their way to markets in Europe is to
end the TIR system. That will never happen. The international
treaty  obligations I have just mentioned were set up by the
Committee  of 300, using its  amazing networks  and control
mechanisms,  to facilitate passage of all manner of drugs to
Western Europe. Forget perishable goods! A former DEA agent
stationed in Italy told me, "TIR=DOPE."
   Remember this the next time you read in the newspapers
that a big haul of heroin was found in a false-bottom suitcase at
Kennedy Airport, and some unlucky "mule" pays the price for
his criminal activity. This kind of action is only "small pota-
toes,"  sand  in  the  eyes  of the  public, to make us think our
government is really doing something about the drug menace.
Take for example, "The French Connection," a Nixon program
embarked upon  without the knowledge and consent of the
committee of 300.
   The entire amount of opium/heroin seized in that massive
effort is somewhat less than one quarter of what a single TIR
truck carries. The Committee of 300 saw to it that Nixon paid a
heavy price for a relatively small seizure of heroin. It was not
the amount of heroin involved, but a matter of one whom they
had helped up the ladder to the White House believing that he
could now do without their help and backing, and even  go
against direct orders from above.
   The mechanics of the heroin trade go like this: wild Thai and
Burmese Hill tribesmen grow the opium poppy. At harvest time,
the  seed-bearing pod is  cut with  a razor or sharp knife. A
resinous substance leaks through the cut and starts to congeal.
This is raw opium. The crop of raw opium is made up into sticky
roundish balls. The tribesman are paid in 1 kilo gold bars--
known as 4/10ths--which are minted by Credit Suisse. These
small bars are used ONLY to pay the tribesman--the normal-
weight gold bars are traded on the Hong Kong market by the big
buyers of raw opium or partly processed heroin. The same
methods are used to pay hill tribesman in India--the Baluchis--

                             120

who have been in this business since the days of the Moguls.
The "Dope Season," as it is called, sees a flood of gold traded on
the Hong Kong market.
   Mexico has started producing relatively small amounts of
heroin called "Mexican Brown" which is much in demand by
the Hollywood crowd. Here again the heroin trade is run by top
government officials who have the military on their side. Some
producers of "Mexican Brown" are making a million dollars a
month by supplying their U.S. clients. On occasions when a few
Mexican Federal police are prodded into taking action against
the heroin producers, they are "taken out" by military units who
seem to appear as if from nowhere.
   Such an incident occurred in November 1991 at an isolated
airstrip in Mexico's opium producing region. Federal narcotics
agents surrounded the strip and were about to arrest people who
were  in the  act of loading heroin  when a squad of soldiers
arrived.  The soldiers rounded up the Federal narcotics police
agents and systematically killed all of them. This action posed
serious threat to Mexican President Goltarin, who is faced with
loud demands for a full-scale investigation into the murders.
Goltarin is over a barrel; he can't back off from calling for an
inquiry, and neither can he afford to offend the military. It is the
first such crack in the tight chain of command in Mexico that
stretches all the way back to the Committee of 300.
   Raw opium from the Golden Triangle is pipelined to the
Sicilian Mafia and the French end of the business for refining in
the laboratories that infest the French coastline from Marseilles
to Monte-Carlo. Nowadays, Lebanon and Turkey are turning
out increasing amounts of refined heroin and a large number of
laboratories have sprung up in these two countries in the past
four years. Pakistan also has a number of laboratories but it is
not in the same league as France, for example.
   The route taken by the raw opium carriers of the Golden
Crescent goes through Iran, Turkey and Lebanon. When the
Shah of Iran was in control of the country, he refused to allow

                             121

the heroin trade to continue and it was forcibly discontinued-
up until the time that he was "dealt with" by the Committee of
300. Raw opium from Turkey and Lebanon finds it way to
Corsica,  from  where  it is  shipped to Monte  Carlo  with the
connivance of the Grimaldi family. Pakistani laboratories, under
the guise of "military defense laboratories" are doing a bigger
share of refining than they were two years ago, but the best
refining is still done along the French Mediterranean coastline
and in Turkey. Here again, banks play a vital role in financing
these operations.
   Let us stop here for a moment. Are we to believe that with all
the modern and vastly improved surveillance techniques, in-
cluding satellite reconnaissance, available to law enforcement
agencies in these countries, that this vile trade cannot be pin-
pointed and stopped? How is it that law enforcement agencies
cannot go in and destroy these laboratories once they are dis-
covered? If this IS the case, and we still cannot interdict the
heroin trade, then our anti-narcotics services ought to be known
as "The Geriatrics" and not drug enforcement agencies.
   Even a child could tell our alleged "drug watchers" what to
do. Simply keep a check on all factories making acetic anhy-
dride, THE most essential chemical component needed by labo-
ratories to refine heroin from raw opium. THEN FOLLOW
THE TRAIL! It is as simple as that! I am reminded of Peter
Sellers in the "Pink Panther" series when I think of law en-
forcement efforts  to locate heroin-refining laboratories. Even
someone as bumbling as the imaginary inspector would have
had no trouble in following the route taken by acetic anhydride
shipments to their final destination.
   Governments could make laws that would oblige manufac-
turers of acetic anhydride to keep scrupulous records showing
who buys the chemical and for what purposes it is to be used.
But do not hold your breath on this one, remember Dope=Big
Business and Big Business is done by the oligarchical families
of Europe and the United States Eastern Liberal Establishment.

                             122

The drug business is not a Mafia operation, nor one run by the
Colombian cocaine cartels. The noble families of Britain and
America's top people are not going to advertise their role in the
shop windows; they always have a layer of front men to do the
dirty work.
   Remember British and AMERICAN "nobility" never dirt-
ied their hands in the China opium trade. The lords and ladies
were much too clever for that, as were the American elite: the
Delanos,  Forbes, Appletons,  Bacons,  Boylestons,  Perkins,
Russells,  Cunninghams,  Shaws,  Coolidges,  Parkmans,
Runnewells, Cabots and Codmans, by no means a complete list
of families in America who grew immensely wealthy from the
China opium trade.
    Since this is not a book about the drug trade, I cannot of
necessity,  cover the  subject  in  an  in-depth  manner.  But its
importance  to  the  Committee  of 300  must  be  emphasized.
America is run not by 60 families but by 300 families and
England is run by 100 families and, as we shall see, these
families are intertwined through marriage, companies, banks,
not to mention ties  to the Black Nobility, Freemasonry, the
Order of St. John of Jerusalem and so on. These are the people
who, through their surrogates, find ways to protect huge ship-
ments of heroin from Hong Kong, Turkey, Iran and Pakistan and
ensure they reach the market places in the U.S. and Western
Europe with the minimum cost of doing business.
   Shipments of cocaine are sometimes interdicted and seized
That is mere window dressing. Often times the shipments seized
belong to a new organization trying to break into the trade. Such
competition is put out of business by informing the authorities
exactly where it is going to enter the U.S. and who the owners
are. The big stuff is never touched; heroin is too expensive. It is
worthy of note that U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency operatives
are not allowed into Hong Kong. They cannot examine any
ship's manifest before it leaves the port. One wonders why, if
there  is  so much "international cooperation" going on--what

                             123

the media likes to characterize as "smashing the dope trade."
Clearly the trade routes for heroin are protected by "a higher
authority. "
   In South America, apart from Mexico, cocaine is king. The
production of cocaine is very simple, unlike heroin, and great
fortunes are to be made by those willing to take risks for and on
behalf of the "higher ups." As in the heroin trade, interlopers are
not welcome and often finish up as casualties, or victims of
family  feuds.  In  Colombia  the  drug  mafia is a closely knit
family. But such has been the bad publicity generated by the
M19 guerrilla attack on the Justice Building in Bogota (M19 is
the private  army  of the cocaine barons)  and the murder of
Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, a prominent prosecutor and a judge, that
the "higher authority" had to rearrange matters in Colombia.
   Accordingly,  the  Ochoas  of the  Medellin  Cartel  turned
themselves in after being assured that they would not suffer any
loss of fortune, harm of any kind, nor would they be extradited
to  the  United  States.  A deal was struck that, provided they
repatriated the bulk of their huge narco-dollar fortunes to Co-
lombian banks, no punitive action would be taken against them.
The Ochoas--Jorge, Fabio, and their top man, Pablo Escobar,
would be held in private jails that resemble a luxury-class motel
room, and then be sentenced to a maximum term of two years--
to be served in the same motel jail. This deal is ongoing. The
Ochoas  have  also been  guaranteed the right to  continue  to
manage their "business" from their motel-prison.
   But that does not mean that the cocaine trade has come to a
screeching halt. On the contrary, it has simply been transferred
to the second-string Cali cartel, and it is business as usual. For
some strange reason the Cali cartel, which is equal in size to the
Medellin cartel, has been--at least up until now--largely ig-
nored by the DEA. Cali differs from the Medellin cartel in that it
is run by BUSINESSMEN, who eschew all forms of violence
and never break agreements.
   Even more significant is that Cali does virtually no business

                             124

in Florida.  My source told me that the Cali cartel is run by
shrewd businessmen unlike any seen in the cocaine business.
He believes that they were "specially appointed," but does not
know by whom. "They never call attention to themselves," he
said. "They do not go around importing red Ferraris like Jorge
Ochoa did, attracting immediate attention, because it is forbid-
den to import such cars into Colombia."
   Cali  cartel  markets  are  in  Los Angeles,  New  York and
Houston, which closely parallel the heroin markets. Cali has not
shown any signs of moving into Florida. A former DEA opera-
tive who is a colleague of mine said recently, "These Cali people
are sure smart. They are a different breed to the Ochoa brothers.
They act like professional businessmen. They are now larger
than the Medellin cartel and I think we are going to see a lot
more cocaine get into the United States than ever before. The
kidnaping of Manuel Noriega will facilitate  an  easier flow
through Panama of cocaine and money, what with so many
banks there. So much for President George Bush's Operation
Just Cause. All  it did was make  life  a  great deal easier for
Nicolas Ardito Barletta who used to be run by the Ochoa brothers
and who is fixing to front for the Cali cartel."
   Based on my experience with the heroin trade I believe that
the Committee of 300 has stepped in and taken over full control
of the South American cocaine trade. There is no other expla-
nation For the rise of the Cali cartel which is coupled with the
kidnaping of Noriega. Did Bush take his orders from London
regarding Noriega? There is every indication that he was literally
PUSHED into invading Panama and kidnaping Noriega, who
had become a serious impediment to "trade" in Panama, espe-
cially in the banking business.
   Several former intelligence agents have given me their opin-
ions  which coincide with my own. Like the Gulf War that
followed in the wake of Panama, it was only after several calls
from the British Ambassedor in Washington that Bush finally
plucked up enough courage to make his totally illegal move on

                             125             

General Noriega. That he was supported by the British press and
the New York Times, a British intelligence run newspaper, speaks
volumes.
    Noriega was formerly the darling of the Washington estab-
lishment. He frequently hob-knobbed with William Casey and
Oliver North and even met with President George Bush on at
least two occasions. Noriega was often seen at the Pentagon
where he was treated like one of those Arab potentates, and the
red carpet was always laid out for him at CIA headquarters in
Langley Virginia. U.S. Army Intelligence and the CIA are on
record as having paid him $320,000.
   Then storm clouds began to appear on the horizon at about
the same time the Cali cartel was taking over the cocaine trade
from the Ochoa brothers and Pablo Escobar. Led by Senator
Jesse  Helms,  who  sold out to Ariel  Sharon  and the Israeli
Histradut Party in 1985, there suddenly began an agitation for
the removal of Noriega. Jesse Helms and those of a like mind
were backed up by Simon Hersh, a British intelligence agent
working for the New York Times, which has been a British intel-
ligence mouthpiece in the U.S. since the time that M16 boss, Sir
William Stephenson, occupied the RCA building in New York.
    It is very significant that Helms should have chosen to lead
the charge against Noriega. Helms is the darling of the Sharon
faction in Washington and Sharon was the principal gun-runner
in Central America and Colombia. Moreover, Helms has the
respect of the  Christian  fundamentalists who believe in the
maxim: "Israel, my country, right or wrong." Thus a powerful
momentum  was  created  to  "get Noriega."  It is  evident that
Noriega could well prove a serious impediment to the interna-
tional drug merchants and their Committee of 300 bankers, so he
had to be removed before he could do some significant damage.
   Bush was pressured by his British masters to conduct an
illegal search and seizure operation in Panama that resulted in
the deaths of no less than 7,000 Panamanians and wanton de-
struction of property. Nothing to implicate Noriega as a "drug

                             126

dealer" was ever found, so he was kidnaped and brought to the
U.S.  in  one  of the  most  blatant examples  of international
brigandry in history. This illegal action probably best meets the
Bush philosophy: "The moral dimensions of American (read
British royal family-Committee of 300) foreign policy require
us to chart a moral course through a world of lesser evils. That's
the real world, not black and while. Very few absolutes."
   It was a "lesser evil" lo kidnap Noriega, rather than have
him up-end the banks in Panama working for the Committee of
300. The Noriega case is a prototype of monstrous One World
government actions waiting in the wings. An emboldened Bush
came right out in the open, unafraid, because we, the people
have put on a spiritual mantle that accommodates LIES  and
wants no part of TRUTH. This is the world we have decided to
accept. If it were not so, a firestorm of anger would have swept
the country over the invasion of Panama, which would not have
stopped until Bush was hounded from office. Nixon's Watergate
transgressions pale into insignificance next to the many im-
peachable offenses committed by President Bush when he or-
dered the invasion of Panama to kidnap General Noriega.
   The government case against Noriega is based upon perjured
testimony by a group of big men, for the most part, already
convicted and lying through their individual and collective teeth
to gel their own sentences lightened. Their performance would
have pleased Gilbert and Sullivan immensely, were they alive
today. "They made them the rulers of DEA," might be apropos
instead of, "They made them the rulers of Queen's Navy," from
"HMS Pinafore." It is an altogether grotesque scene to see how
these con-artists are performing like not-so-well-trained seals
for the U.S. Justice Department; that is if we care to insult such
a nice clean animal by such an unworthy comparison.
   Key dates conflict wildly, key details are altogether con-
spicuous by their absence, lapses of memory on crucial points
all add up to the obvious fact that the government has no case
against Noriega, but that does not matter; the Royal Institute for

                             127

International Affairs (RIIA) says "convict him anyway" and that
is what poor Noriega can expect. One of the Justice Department's
star witnesses is one Floyd Carlton Caceres, a former pilot for
the Ochoa brothers. Following his arrest in 1986, Carlton tried
to ease his position at the expense of Noriega.

--- Committee of 300 - Part 6 ---------------------------------------


   He told his DEA interrogators that the Ochoa brothers had
paid Noriega $600,000 to allow three planes loaded with cocaine
to land and refuel in Panama. But once in court in Miami, it soon
became apparent that what was billed as the "star witness" for
the prosecution was at best damp squib. Under cross-examination
the true story emerged: Far from being paid to allow the flights,
Noriega wasn't even approached by the Ochoas. Worse yet, in
December of 1983, Noriega had ordered that all flights to Panama
from Medellin be refused permission to land in Panama. Carlton
is not the only discredited witness.
   One who is even a sorrier liar than Carlton is Carlos Lehder,
who was a kingpin in the Medellin Cartel until he was arrested
in Spain and sent to the U.S. Who gave the DEA the most vital
information that Lehder was in Madrid? The DEA reluctantly
concedes that they owe this important catch to Noriega. Now,
however, the Justice Department is using Lehder as a witness
against Noriega.  If nothing  else,  this  single  witness  demon-
strates the wretchedness of the United States government's case
against Manuel Noriega.
   In return for services rendered, Lehder has been granted an
easing of his sentence and far nicer quarters--a room with a
view and television--and his family was given permanent res-
idence in the U.S. Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney who
prosecuted Lehder in 1988 told the Washington Pose "I don't
think the government should be in the business of dealing with
Carlos Lehder, period. This guy is a liar from beginning to end.
   The Justice Department, purely a name which bears no
resemblance to what it is supposed to stand for, has pulled out
all its dirty tricks against Noriega: illegally wire-tapping his
conversations with his lawyer; appointing a government lawyer

                             128

to pretend he was serving Noriega but who quit in the middle of
everything; freezing his bank accounts so that Noriega is unable
to conduct a proper defense; kidnaping, illegal search and seizure.
You name it, the government has broken more laws than Noriega
has ever done--if indeed he has broken any laws at all.
   It is the U.S. Justice Department that is on trial tenfold more
than General Noriega. The Noriega case shows the glaringly
evil system that passes for "justice" in this country. The U.S.
"war on drugs" is on trial as is the Bush Administration's so-
called drug policy. The Noriega trial, although it will end in a
violent and flagrant rape of justice, will nevertheless offer some
compensation to those who are not blind, deaf and dumb. It
proves for once  and for  all  that Britain is in charge of our
government and it will reveal the utterly bankrupt ideology of
the Bush Administration which ought to have as its motto, "No
Matter What, The End Always Justifies The Means. There Are
Very Few Moral Absolutes." Like the majority of politicians, for
Bush to have a standard of ABSOLUTE MORALITY WOULD
BE SUICIDAL. Only in this climate could we have allowed
President Bush to violate at least six United States laws and
DOZENS OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS in going to
war against Iraq.
   What we are witnessing in Colombia and Washington is a
complete revision of how the cocaine trade is to be run; no more
wild stuff, no more blazing guns. Let the gentlemen of the Cali
cartel in pin-stripe suits conduct the business in a gentlemanly
way  In short, the Committee of 300 has taken a direct hand in
the cocaine trade which henceforth will go as smoothly as the
heroin trade. The new government of Colombia is geared to the
change in tactics and direction. It is on notice to perform ac-
cording to the Committee's game plan.
   There is need to mention U.S. participation in the China
opium trade which began in the southern United States prior to
the War Between The States. How can we tie the opium trade in
with the great cotton plantations of the South? To do that, we

                             129

have to start in Bengal, India, producers of the finest (if one can
call  such a foul  substance fine) opium which was much  in
demand. Cotton was THE biggest trade in England, after opium
sales through the BEIC.
   Most of the cotton from Southern plantations was worked in
the slave mills of Northern England, where women and children
earned a pittance for a 16-hour day's work. The cloth mills were
owned by  the wealthy  socialites in London, the Barings,
Palmerstons, Keswicks and most of all the Jardine Mathesons
who owned the Blue Star Shipping Line, on which the finished
cotton cloth goods were shipped to India. They could care less
about the hapless conditions endured by Her Majesty's subject.
After all, that is what they were for, and their husbands and sons
were useful for fighting wars to preserve Her Majesty's far-
flung empire as they had done for centuries, and latterly, in the
bloody Boer War. That was British tradition, wasn't it?
    Cotton cloth finished goods exported to India undercut and
destroyed the long-standing Indian producers of cotton finished
goods trade.  Terrible privation  was endured by thousands of
Indians thrown out of work as a result of cheaper British goods
taking over their markets. India then became utterly dependent
upon Britain to earn enough currency to pay for its railroads and
finished cotton goods imports. There was only one solution to
India's economic woes. Produce more opium and sell it for less
to the  British East India Company. This was the rock upon
which  British trade  grew and flourished. Without its opium
trade, Britain would have been as bankrupt.
   Did the Southern plantation owners know about the ugly
secret of opium-for-cotton goods? It is unlikely that some of
them didn't know what was going on. Take, for instance, the
Sutherland family, one of the largest cotton plantation owners in
the South. The Sutherlands were closely related to the Matheson
family--Jardine Matheson--who in turn had as their business
partners the Baring Brothers, founders of the famous Peninsular
and Orient Navigation Line (P&O), the largest of Britain's many

                             130
                                   
merchant shipping lines.
   The Barings were big investors in Southern plantations as
they were in the U.S. Clipper ships which plowed through the
seas between Chinese ports and all the important ports along the
eastern seaboard of the United States. Today the Barings run a
number of very substantial financial operations in the United
States. All of those names mentioned were, and their descen-
dants still are, members of the Committee of 300.
   The majority of families who go to make up the Eastern
Liberal Establishment, among whom are the wealthiest to be
found in this country, derived their fortunes from either the
cotton trade or the opium trade and in some instances from both.
Of these the Lehmans are an outstanding example. When it
comes to fortunes made solely from the China opium trade, the
first names that come to mind are the Astors and the Delanos.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt's wife was a Delano.
   John Jacob Astor made a huge fortune out of the China
opium trade and then he went respectable by buying up large
tracts of Manhattan real estate with his dirty money. During his
lifetime Astor played  a  big role  in  the  Committee  of 300s'
deliberations. In fact, it was the Committee of 300 who chose
who would be allowed to participate in the fabulously lucrative
China opium trade, through its monopolist BEIC, and the ben-
eficiaries of their largess remained forever wedded to the Com-
mittee of 300.
   That is why, as we shall discover, most real estate in Man-
hattan belongs to various Committee members, even as it has
since the days when Astor began buying it up. With the benefit
of access to records that would be closed to others outside of
British intelligence, I discovered that Astor had long been an
asset of British intelligence in the United States. Astor's financing
of Aaron Burr, the murderer of Alexander Hamilton, proves the
point beyond any reasonable doubt.
  John Jacob Astor's son, Waldorf Astor, had the additional
honor bestowed upon him of being appointed to the Royal

                             131

Institute for International Affairs (RIIA), through which organi-
zation the Committee of 300 controls every facet of our lives in
the United States. The Astor family is believed to have selected
Owen Lattimore to carry  on their association with the opium
trade which he did through the Laura Spelman-funded Institute
for Pacific Relations (IPR). It was the IPR that oversaw China's
entry into the opium trade as an equal partner and not merely as
a supplier. It was IPR that paved the way for the Japanese attack
on Pearl  Harbor. Attempts  to turn the Japanese  into  opium
addicts met with dismal failure.
   By the turn of the century the oligarchical plutocrats  of
Britain were like overgorged vultures on the Serengeti Plain at
the time of the annual Wildebeest march. Their income from the
China opium trade exceeded David Rockefeller's income by
SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS PER ANNUM. Historic
records made available to me in the British Museum in London
and from India Office and other sources--former colleagues in
well-placed positions, proves this completely.
   By 1905, the Chinese government, deeply concerned about
the rise in the number of opium addicts in China, tried to get
help  from the  international  community.  Britain pretended to
cooperate, but made no move whatsoever to abide by the 1905
protocols it had signed. Later Her Majesty's government did an
about-face after showing China that it was better to join them in
the opium business rather than to try and end it.
   Even The Hague Convention was scoffed at by the British.
Delegates to the convention had agreed that Britain must abide
by the protocols it had signed, which was to drastically reduce
the amount of opium sold in China and elsewhere. The British,
while paying lip service, had no intention of giving up their
trade in human misery, which included the so-called "pig trade."
   Their servant, President George Bush, in prosecution of the
cruel war of genocide waged against the Iraqi nation SOLELY
for and on behalf of British interests, likewise showed his
contempt by flouting the Hague Agreement on Aerial Bombard-

                             132

ment, and a whole slew of international conventions to which the
U.S. is a signatory, including ALL of the Geneva Conventions.
   When evidence was produced two years later, notably by the
Japanese,  who  were  growing  very  concerned  about  British
smuggling of opium into their country, that opium sales had
increased instead of decreased, then Her Majesty's delegate to
the Fifth Hague Convention produced a set of statistics which
were  at  variance  with those provided by Japan.  The  British
delegate turned the tables by saying that it made a very strong
case for legalizing the sale of opium which would have the
effect of doing away with what he called "the black market."
   He suggested on behalf of Her Majesty's government that
the Japanese government would then have a monopoly and full
control of the trade. THIS IS PRECISELY THE SAME ARGU-
MENT BEING ADVANCED BY THE FRONT MEN FOR
THE BRONFMANS AND OTHER BIG-TIME DOPE DEAL-
ERS--LEGALIZE COCAINE, MARIJUANA AND HEROIN,
LET THE U.S GOVERNMENT HAVE THE MONOPOLY
AND THEREBY STOP WASTING BILLIONS ON THE
PHONY WAR ON DRUGS AND SAVE THE TAXPAYERS
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
   In the period of 1791-1894, the number of licensed opium
dens in the Shanghai International Settlement rose from 87 to
663. Opium flowing into the United States was also stepped up.
Sensing that they might have some problems in China with the
spotlight of world concern shining upon them, the plutocrats of
the Knights of St. John and the Order of the Garter, transferred
some of their attention to Persia (Iran).
  Lord Inchcape, who founded the biggest steamship company
in the world at the turn of the  19th century, the legendary
Peninsula and Orient Steam Navigation Company,  was the
principal mover and shaker in establishing the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Bank, which remains the largest and least controlled
clearinghouse bank for the opium trade, which also financed the
"pig trade" with the United States.

                             133

   The British had set up a scam whereby Chinese "coolies"
were sent to the U.S. as so-called indentured laborers. The
rapacious Harriman family's railroad needed "coolies" to push
the rail connection westward to the California coast, or so they
said. Strangely enough, very few Negroes were given the manual
labor jobs they were used to at that time and could have done a
better job than the emaciated opium addicts who arrived from
China.
   The problem was that there was no market for opium among
the Negroes and, moreover, Lord Inchcape, son of the founder
of P and O needed the "coolies" to smuggle in thousands of
pounds of raw opium into North America, something the Negroes
could not do. It was the same Lord Inchcape who in  1923
warned that there must be no diminishing of opium poppy
cultivation in Bengal. "This most important source of revenue
must be safeguarded," he told the commission allegedly inves-
tigating the production of opium gum in India.
    By 1846, some 120,000 "coolies" had already arrived in the
U.S. to work on Harriman's railroad pushing westward. The
"pig trade" was in full profitable swing because, of this number,
it was estimated by the U.S. government 115,000 were opium
addicts. Once the railroad was finished, the Chinese did not go
back to where they came from, but settled in San Francisco, Los
Angeles, Vancouver and Portland. They created a huge culture
problem that has never ceased to exist.
   It is interesting to note that Cecil John Rhodes, a Committee
of 300 member who fronted for the Rothschilds in South Africa
followed the Inchcape pattern, bringing hundreds of thousand of
Indian "coolies" to work on the sugar cane plantations in Natal
province. Among them was Mahatma Ghandi, a Communist
agitator and troublemaker. Like the Chinese coolies, they were
not  returned  to  their  country  of origin  once  their  contracts
expired. They, too, went on to create a massive social program,
and their descendants became lawyers  who  spearheaded the
drive  to  infiltrate  the  government  on behalf of the  Africa

                             134

National Congress.
    By 1875 the Chinese "coolies" operating out of San Francisco
had set up an opium supply ring that resulted in 129,000 American
opium addicts. What with the known 115,000 Chinese addicts,
Lord Inchcape and his family were raking in hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars a year from this source alone which, in terms of
today's dollar would represent at least a $100 million dollar
income every year.
   The  very  same  British and American families  who  had
combined to wreck the Indian textile industry in the promotion
of the opium trade, and who brought African slaves to the U.S.
combined to make the "pig trade" a valuable source of revenue.
Later they were to combine to cause and promote the terrible
War Between The States, also known as the American Civil War.
   The decadent American families of the unholy partnership,
thoroughly corrupted and wallowing in filthy lucre, went on to
become what we know today as the Eastern Liberal Establishmemt
whose members, under the careful guidance and direction of the
Crown and subsequently its foreign policy executive arm, the
Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA), ran this coun-
ry--and still does--from top to bottom through their secret
upper-level, parallel government, which is tightly meshed with
the Committee of 300, the ULTIMATE secret society.
   By 1923, voices were being raised against this menace that
had been allowed to be imported into the United States. Believ-
ing the United States to be a free and sovereign nation, Con-
gressman Stephen Porter, Chairman of the House of Represen-
tatives Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced a bill which called
for the British to account for their opium export-import business
on a country-by-country basis. The resolution set up quotas for
each country, which if observed, would have reduced the opium
made by lO%. The resolution was passed into law and the bill
accepted by the Congress of the United States.
   But the Royal Institute of International Affairs had other
ideas. Founded in 1919 in the wake of the Paris Peace Conference

                             135

held at Versailles, this was one of the earliest "foreign policy"
executors of the Committee of 300. Research I have done on the
Congressional Records,  House,  show that Porter was totally
unaware of the powerful forces he was up against. Porter was
not even aware of the existence of the RIIA, much less that its
specific purpose was to control every facet of the United States.
   Apparently Congressman Porter received some kind of an
intimation from the Morgan Bank on Wall Street that he should
drop the whole affair. Instead, an enraged Porter took his case to
the League of Nations Opium Committee. Porter's total un-
awareness of who he was up against is demonstrated in some of
his correspondence to colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee in response to open British opposition to his proposals.
   Her Majesty's representative chided Porter and then, acting
like a father toward an errant son, the British delegate--on
instructions from the RIIA--presented Her Majesty's proposals
to INCREASE opium quotas to account for an increase in the
consumption of opium for medicinal purposes. According to
documents that I was able to find in The Hague, Porter was at
first confused, then amazed and then enraged. Joined by the
Chinese  delegate,  Porter  stormed  out  of the  plenipotentiary
session of the Committee session, leaving the field to the British.
   In his absence, the British delegate got the League to rubber
stamp Her Majesty's government proposals for a creation of a
tame-tiger Central Narcotics Board, whose chief function was
information gathering, the terms of which were purposely vague.
What was to be done with the "information" was never made
clear. Porter returned to the U.S. a shaken and much wiser man.
   Another British intelligence asset was the fabulously rich
William Bingham, into which family one of the Barings married.
It was stated in papers and documents that I saw that the Baring
Brothers ran the Philadelphia Quakers and owned half of the
real estate of that city, all made possible because of the fortune
the Baring Brothers had amassed from the China opium trade.
Another beneficiary of the Committee of 300's largess  was

                              136

Stephen Girard, whose descendants inherited the Girard Bank
and Trust.
   The names of the families, whose history is intertwined with
that of Boston and who would never give us ordinary folk the
time of day, were wrapped in the arms of the Committee of 300
and its vastly lucrative BEIC China opium trade. Many of the
famous families became associated with the notorious Hong
Kong and Shanghai Bank which is still the clearing house for
billions of dollars that flow from the opium trade in China.
   Such famous names as Forbes, Perkins and Hathaway ap-
pear in the records of the British East India Company. These
genuine American "bluebloods" created Russell and Company,
whose main trade was in opium, but also ran other shipping
enterprises  from  China to South America and all points in
between. As a reward for their services to the British Crown and
the BEIC, the Committee of 300 granted them a monopoly in the
slave trade in 1833.
   Boston owes its celebrated past to the cotton-opium-slave
trade granted to it by the Committee of 300 and it is stated in the
records I was privileged to see in London that Boston's merchant
families were the chief supporters of the British Crown in the
United States. John Murray Forbes is mentioned as the major-
domo of the "Boston Blue Bloods" in India House records and
in bank records in Hong Kong.
   Forbe's son was the first American allowed by the Commit-
tee of 300 to sit on the board of the most prestigious drug bank in
the world--even today--the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank.
When I was in Hong Kong in the early 1960's as "an historian
interested in the British East India Company," I was shown
some old records, including past board members of this notori-
ous drug bank, and sure enough, Forbes' name was among them.
   The Perkins family,  so illustrious that their name is still
mentioned in awed whispers, were deeply involved in the ne-
farious filthy China opium trade. In fact Perkins the elder was
one of the first Americans to be elected to the Committee of 3OO.

                              137

His son, Thomas Nelson, was Morgan's man in Boston,
and as such also an agent for British intelligence. His unsavory--
I would say disgusting--past was not in question when he richly
endowed Harvard University. After all, Canton and Tientsin are
a long way from Boston, and who would have cared anyway?
   What helped The Perkinses a lot was that Morgan was a
powerful  member of the  Committee  of 300, which enabled
Thomas N. Perkins to rapidly further his career in the China
opium trade. All the Morgans and Perkinses were Freemasons,
which was another tie that bound them together, for only Free-
masons of highest rank have any hope of being selected by the
Committee of 300. Sir Robert Hart, who for almost three decades
was chief of the Imperial Chinese Customs Service (read the
British Crown's number one agent in the opium trade in China
was subsequently appointed to the board of Morgan Guarantee
Bank's Far Eastern Division.
   Through  access  to the historical records  in London  and
Hong Kong, I was able to establish that Sir Robert developed an
intimate  relationship  with  Morgan  operations  in  the  United
States. It is worthy of note that Morgan interests in the opium/
heroin trade have continued in an unbroken line; witness the
fact that David Newbigging is on the advisory board of Morgan's
Hong Kong operation run in conjunction with Jardine Matheson.
   To those who know Hong Kong, the name of Newbigging
will be familiar as the most powerful name in Hong Kong. In
addition to his membership of Morgan's elite bank, Newbigging
doubles as an advisor to the Chinese government. Opium for
missile technology, opium for gold, opium for high-tech com-
puters--it is all the same to Newbigging. The way these banks
financial houses, trading companies and the families who run
them  are  intertwined  would perplex  Sherlock  Holmes,  yet
somehow they must be unraveled and followed if we are to
understand  their  connections  with  the  drug trade and their
membership in the Committee of 300.
   The two-track entry into the United States of alcohol and

                              138

drugs were products of the same stable occupied by the same
thoroughbreds. First, prohibition had to be introduced into the
United States. This was done by the British East India Company
heirs  who,  acting upon experience gained through the  well-
documented China Inland Mission records found in India House,
set up the Women's Christian Temperance Union, supposedly to
oppose consumption of alcohol in America.
    We say that history repeats itself, and in a sense, this is true.
except that it repeats itself in an ever-upward spiral. Today we
find that some of the largest companies, allegedly "polluting"
the earth, are the largest contributors of funds to the environ-
mentalist movement. The "big names" send forth their message.
Prince Philip is one of their heroes, yet his son Prince Charles
owns  a million  acres  of forested land in Wales from which
timber is regularly harvested and, in addition, Prince Charles is
one of the largest owners of slum housing in London, where
pollution thrives.
   In the case of those who railed against the "evils of drink,"
we find they were financed by the Astors, the Rockefellers, the
Spelmans, the Vanderbilts and the Warburgs who had a vested
interest in the liquor trade. On the instructions of the Crown,
Lord Beaverbrook came over from England to tell these wealthy
American families that they were to invest in the WCTU. (It was
the same Lord Beaverbrook who came to Washington in 1940
and ORDERED Roosevelt to get involved in Britain's war.)
  Roosevelt complied by stationing a U.S. Navy flotilla in
Greenland that spent the 9 months prior to Pearl Harbor hunting
and attacking German U-Boats.  Like his  successor,  George
Bush, Roosevelt thought the Congress a confounded nuisance
so, acting like a king-- sense he felt strongly since he is related
to the British royal family--FDR never sought the permission of
Congress for his illegal action. This is what the British are most
fond of referring to as their "special relationship with America."
  The drug trade has a connection with the murder of Presi-
dent  John  F.  Kennedy,  which  foul  deed  stains  the  national

                              139

character and will continue to do so until the perpetrators are
found and brought to justice. There is proof that the Mafia was
involved in this through the CIA, which brings to mind that it all
started with the old Meyer Lansky network which evolved into
the Irgun terrorist organization, and Lansky proved to be one of
the best vehicles for peddling cultural warfare against the West.
   Lansky  was, through more respectable fronts,  associated
with  the  British  higher-ups  in  bringing  gambling  and  dope
distribution to Paradise Island in the Bahamas under the cover
of The Mary Carter Paint Company--a joint Lansky-British
M16 venture. Lord Sassoon was later murdered because he was
skimming money and was threatening to blow the whistle if he
was punished. Ray Wolfe was more presentable, representing
the Bronfmans of Canada. While the Bronfmans were not privy
to Churchill's massive Nova Scotia Project, they were and still
are nevertheless an important asset of the British royal family in
the business of dope peddling.
   Sam Rothberg, close associate of Meyer Lansky, also worked
with Tibor Rosenbaum and Pinchas Sapir, all king pins in the
Lansky drug ring. Rosenbaum ran a drug money laundering
operation out of Switzerland through a bank he established for
this purpose; Banque du Credite International. The bank quickly
expanded its activities and became the principal bank used by
Lansky and his mobster associates for laundering money garnered
from prostitution, drugs and other Mafia rackets.
   It is worthy of note that Tibor Rosenbaum's bank was used
by  the  shadowy  chief of British  Intelligence,  Sir  William
Stephenson,  whose right hand man,  Major John  Mortimer
Bloomfield, a Canadian citizen, ran Division Five of the FBI
throughout the Second World War. Stephenson was an early
member  of the  2Oth  century  Committee  of 300,  although
Bloomfield never made it that far. As I revealed in my series of
monographs on the Kennedy assassination, it was Stephenson
who master-minded the operation which was run as a hands-on
project by Bloomfield. Fronting for the Kennedy assassination

                              140

was done through another drug-related front, Permanent Indus-
trial Expositions (PERMINDEX), created in 1957 and centered
in the World Trade Mart building in downtown New Orleans.
   Bloomfield just happened to be the attorney for the Bronfman
family. The World Trade Mart was created by Colonel Clay
Shaw and FBI Division Five station chief in New Orleans, Guy
Bannister. Shaw and Bannister were close associates of Lee
Harvey Oswald, accused of shooting Kennedy, who was mur-
dered by CIA contract agent Jack Ruby before he could prove
that he was not the assassin who shot President Kennedy. In
spite of the Warren Commission and numerous official reports,
it has NEVER been established that Oswald owned  the
Mannlicher rifle said to be the murder weapon (it was not) nor
that he had ever fired it. The connection between the drug trade,
Shaw, Bannister and Bloomfield has been established several
times, and need not concern us here.
   In the immediate post-WW II period, one of the most com-
mon methods  used by Resorts  International  and other drug
related companies to clean money was by courier service to a
money laundering bank. Now all that has changed. Only the
small fry still use such a risky method. The "big fish" conduit
their money via the CHIPS system, an acronym for Clearing
House  International Payments  System, run by  a Burroughs
computer system centered at the New York Clearing House.
Twelve of the largest banks use this system. One of them is the
Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. Another is Credite Suisse, that
oh so respectable paragon of virtue in banking--until the lid is
lifted.  Combined with the  SWIFT system based in Virginia,
dirty drug money becomes invisible. Only wanton carelessness
results in the FBI getting lucky now and then, if and when it is
told not to look the other way.
  Only low echelon drug dealers get caught with drug money
in their hands. The elite, Drexel Burnham, Credite Suisse, Hong
Kong and Shanghai Bank, escape detection. But this, too, is
changing with the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce

                              141

International (BCCI) which is  likely to expose  a great deal
about the drug trade if ever a proper investigation is carried out.
   One of the largest assets in the portfolio of the Committee of
300 companies is American Express (AMEX). Its presidents
regularly occupy positions on the Committee of 300. I first got
interested in Amex when I was carrying out an on-the-spot
investigation that led me to the Trade Development Bank in
Geneva. Later, this got me into a lot of trouble. I discovered that
Trade Development Bank, then run by Edmund Safra, key man
in the gold for opium trade, was supplying tons of gold to the
Hong Kong market via Trade Development Bank.
   Before going to Switzerland, I went to Pretoria, South Africa,
where  I talked with Dr.  Chris  Stals, at that time the deputy
governor of the South African Reserve Bank which controls all
bulk dealings  in  South African-produced gold. After several
discussions over a period of a week, I was told that the bank
could  not  supply  me  with  the  ten  tons of gold that I was
authorized to buy on behalf of clients I was supposed to be
representing. My friends in the right places knew how to produce
the documentation which passed without question.
   The Reserve Bank referred me to a Swiss company whom I
cannot name, because it would blow cover. I was also given the
address of Trade Development Bank in Geneva. The purpose of
my exercise was to find out the mechanics of how gold is moved
and traded, and secondly to test bogus documents which had been
prepared for me by ex-intelligence friends of mine who special-
ized in this kind of thing. Remember "M" in the "James Bond"
series? Let me assure you that "M" does exist, only his correct
initial is "C." The documents I had consisted of "buying orders"
from Liechtenstein companies with supporting papers to match.
   On approaching Trade Development Bank I was at first
greeted cordially but, as discussions progressed with more and
more suspicion until, when I felt it was no longer safe for me to
visit the bank, without telling anyone at the bank I left Geneva.
Later the bank was sold to American Express. American Express

                              142

was  briefly  investigated by  former Attorney  General  Edwin
Meese, after which he was quickly removed from office and
labeled "corrupt." What I found was that American Express was
and still is a conduit for laundering drug money and, thus far, no
one has been able to explain to me why a private company has
the right to print dollars--aren't American Express travelers
checks dollars? I subsequently exposed the Safra-Amex drug
connections which upset a lot of people, as can be imagined.
  Committee of 300 member Japhet controls Charterhouse
Japhet, which in turn controls Jardine Matheson as a direct link
to  the  Hong  Kong  opium trade.  The Japhets  are  reportedly
English Quakers. The Matheson family, also members of the
Committee of 300, were kingpins in the China opium trade, at
least up until 1943. The Mathesons have appeared in the Queen
of England Honors List since the early 19th century.
   The top controllers of the drug trade in the Committee of
300 have no conscience about the millions of lives they ruin
each year. They are Gnostics, Cathars, members of the cult of
Dionysus,  Osiris,  or worse.  To them,  "ordinary"  people  are
there to be used for their purposes. Their high-priests, Bulwer-
Lytton and Aldous Huxley, preached the gospel of drugs as a
beneficial substance. To quote Huxley:

   "And for private everyday use, there have always been
   chemical  intoxicants. All  the vegetable  sedatives  and
   narcotics, all the euphorics that grow on trees, the hal-
   lucinogens  that ripen in berries, have been used by
   humans since time immemorial. And to these modifiers
   of conscience, modern science has added its quota of
   synthetics. For unrestricted use the West has permitted
   only alcohol and tobacco. All other chemical Doors in
   the Wall are labeled DOPE."

   To the oligarches and plutocrats of the Committee of 300,
drugs have a two-fold purpose, firstly to bring in colossal sums

                              143

 of money and secondly, to eventually turn a major part of the
population into mindless drug zombies who will be easier to
control than people who don't need drugs, as punishment for
rebellion will mean withholding of supplies of heroin, cocaine,
marijuana, etc. For this it is necessary to legalize drugs so that a
MONOPOLY SYSTEM, which has been readied for introduc-
tion once severe economic conditions, of which the 1991 de-
pression is the forerunner, cause drug usage to proliferate as
hundreds of thousands of permanently jobless workers turn to
drugs for solace.
    In  one  of the  Royal Institute of International Affairs top
secret papers, the scenario is laid out as follows (in part):

   "...having been failed by Christianity, and with unem-
   ployment on every hand, those who have been without
   jobs for five years or more will turn  away from the
   church and seek solace in drugs. That is when full con-
   trol of the drug trade must be completed in order that the
   governments of all countries who are under our juris-
   diction will have a MONOPOLY which we will control
   through supply.... Drug bars will take care of the unruly
   and  the  discontent,  would  be  revolutionaries  will  be
   turned into harmless addicts with no will of their own...."

   There is ample evidence that the CIA and British intelli-
gence,  specially  M16,  have  already  spent at least  a  decade
working toward this goal.
    The Royal Institute of International Affairs used the life-
time work of Aldous Huxley and Bulwer-Lytton as its blueprint
to bring about a state where mankind will no longer have wills
of their own in the One World Government-New World Order of
the fast-approaching New Dark Age. Again, let us see what high
priest Aldous Huxley had to say about this:

   "In many societies at many levels of civilization, attempts

                              144

   have been made to fuse drug intoxication with God
   intoxication. In ancient Greece, for example, ethyl alcohol
   had  its  place  in  the  established  religions.  Dionysus,
   Bacchus, as he was often called, was a true divinity.
   Complete prohibition of chemical changes can be decreed
   but cannot be enforced. (THE LANGUAGE OF THE
   PRO-DRUG LOBBY ON CAPITOL HILL.)

   "Now let us consider another type of drug--still undis-
   covered, but probably just around the corner--a drug
   making people happy in situations where they would
   normally feel miserable. (Is there anyone more miserable
   than a person who has sought and been unable to find
   work?) Such a drug would be a blessing, but a blessing
   fraught with grave social and political dangers. By making
   a harmless chemical euphoria freely available, a dictator
   (read  Committee  of 300)  could  reconcile  an  entire
   population to a state of affairs to which self-respecting
   human beings ought not to be reconciled."

   Quite a dialectical masterpiece. What Huxley was advocat-
ing and which is official policy of the Committee of 300 and its
surrogate, RIIA, can be quite simply stated as mass mind control.
As I have often said, all wars are wars for the souls of mankind.
Thus far it has not dawned on us that the drug trade is irregular
low-intensity  warfare against the  whole human race of free
men.  Irregular warfare is the most terrible form of warfare
which, while it has a beginning, has no ending.
   Some will question the involvement of the British royal
families, past and present, in the drug trade. To see it in print
appears on the surface to be preposterous, and it is being seen in
print more often these days  to  make  it  appear  exactly  that,
preposterous. The oldest maxim in the intelligence business is,
"If you want to hide something, put it where everyone can see it.
   F. S. Turner's book, "BRITISH OPIUM POLICY," pub-

                              145

lished in 1876, shows how the British monarchy and its hang-
ers-on family relatives were deeply involved in the opium trade.
Turner was the secretary of the Anglo Oriental Society of the
Suppression of the Opium Trade. He declined to be silenced by
Crown spokesperson Sir R. Temple. Turner stated that the gov-
ernment, and therefore the Crown, had to withdraw from the
opium monopoly, "and if it takes any revenues at all, take only
that which  accrues  from taxation honestly  meant  to have a
restrictive force. "
   Turner was answered by a spokesman for the monarchy,
Lord Lawrence, who fought against the BEIC losing its mo-
nopoly. "It would be desirable to get rid of the monopoly, but I
myself am disinclined to  be  the  agent of change.  If it  is
question of moderate loss that we could afford, I would not
hesitate to undertake it." (Taken from the Calcutta Papers 1870.)
   By  1874  the  war against the British monarchy  and  the
aristocracy over its deep involvement in the China opium trade
was  getting heated.  The  Society for the  Suppression of the
Opium Trade violently assailed the aristocracy of the day and
pressed home its attacks in a fearless manner we would do well
to emulate. The society said that the Treaty of Tientsin, which
Forced China to accept the importation of enormous amounts of
opium, was a dastardly crime against the Chinese people.
   There arose a mighty warrior, Joseph Grundy Alexander, a
barrister by profession who, in 1866, led a strong attack on
British Crown opium policy in China in which he openly men-
tioned the involvement of the royal family and the aristocracy.
For the first time Alexander brought India, "the Jewel in the
Crown," into the picture. He laid the blame squarely where it
belonged, on the monarchy, the so-called aristocracy and its
servants in the British government.
   Under the direction of Alexander, the society committed
itself to the total destruction of the cultivation of opium poppies
in Bengal, India. Alexander proved to be a doughty opponent.
Through his leadership, the drug aristocracy began to falter and,

                              146

in the face of his open denouncements of the royal family and its
hangers-on, several Members of Parliament began siding with
him   Conservatives, Unionists, Labor. Alexander made it clear
that the drug trade was not a party political issue; it was for all
parties to join together in helping to eradicate the menace.
   Lord  Kimberly,  spokesman for the royal  family  and the
entrenched oligarchists, threatened that any attempts to interfere
with what he called "the commerce of the nation will run into
serious opposition from the cabinet." Alexander and his society
pressed on in the face of innumerable threats and finally parlia-
ment agreed to appoint a Royal Commission to enquire into the
opium trade, with Lord Kimberly, who was Secretary of India,
as its chairman. A more inappropriate person to head the com-
mission could not have been found. It was akin to Dulles being
appointed to the Warren Commission.
   In his first statement, Lord Kimberly made it clear that he
would rather resign from his august position than consent to a
resolution that would surrender Indian Opium Revenues.  It is
worthy of note that "Indian Opium Revenue" implied money
shared by the nation. Like the idea that the people of South
Africa share in the enormous profits from the sale of gold and
diamonds, this was just not the case. Indian opium revenues
went straight into  the royal coffers and the pockets of the
nobility  and  the  oligarchists  and plutocrats, and made them
billionaires.
  Rowntree's book, "THE IMPERIAL DRUG TRADE" gives
a fascinating account of how Prime Minister Gladstone and his
fellow plutocrats lied, cheated, twisted and turned to keep the
astonishing truth of the involvement of the British monarchy in
the opium trade from being exposed. Rowntree's book is a
treasure house of information on the deep involvement of the
British royal family and the lords and ladies of England and the
huge fortunes they accumulated from the misery of the Chinese
opium addicts.
   Lord Kimberly, secretary of the commission of inquiry, was

                              147

himself deeply involved in the opium trade so he did everything
in his power to close the proceedings to all who sought the truth.
Finally, under a great deal of pressure from the public, the Royal
Commission was forced to open the door to this inquiry just a
crack, so that it became apparent that the highest in the land
were running the opium trade and receiving huge benefits from
it. But the door was quickly slammed shut again, and the Royal
Commission called no expert witnesses, thereafter sitting for an
absurdly short period of time. The commission was nothing but
a farce and a cover-up, such as we have become accustomed to
in 20th century America.
   The Eastern Liberal Establishment families of the United
States were just as deeply involved in the China opium trade as
were the British, indeed they still are. Witness recent history
when James Earl Carter toppled the Shah of Iran. Why was the
Shah deposed and then murdered by the United States govern-
ment? fn a word, because of DRUGS. The Shah had clamped
down and virtually put an end to the immensely lucrative opium
trade being conducted out of Iran by the British. At the time that
the  Shah  took  over in  Iran, there were already one million
opium/heroin addicts.
   This the British would not tolerate, so they sent the United
States to do their dirty work for them in terms of the "special
relationship" between the two countries. When Khomeini took
over the U.S. Embassy in Teheran, arms sales by the United
States, which had begun with the Shah, were not discontinued.
Why not? Had the United States done so, Khomeini would have
canceled the British monopoly of the opium trade in his country.
To prove the point, after 1984, Khomeini's liberal attitude toward
opium had increased the number of addicts to 2 million, according
to United Nations and World Health Organization statistics.
   Both President Carter and his successor, Ronald Reagan,
willingly and with full knowledge of what was at stake, went on
supplying arms to Iran even while American hostages languished
in captivity. In 1980 I wrote a monograph under the title, "What

                              148

Really Happened in Iran," which set out the facts. The arms
trade with Iran was sealed at a meeting between Cyrus Vance, a
servant of the  Committee  of 300,  and Dr.  Hashemi,  which
resulted in the U.S. Air Force beginning an immediate airlift of
arms to Iran, carried on even at the height of the hostage crisis
the arms came from U.S. Army stockpiles in Germany and
some were even flown directly from the United States with
refueling stops at the Azores.
   With the advent of Khomeini, who was put in power in Iran
by the Committee of 300, opium production skyrocketed. By
1984 Iran's opium production exceeded 650 metric tons of
opium per annum. What Carter and Reagan did was ensure that
there was no further interference in the opium trade and they
carried out the mandate given to them by the oligarchical fami-
lies in Britain in this connection. Iran presently rivals the Golden
Triangle in the volume of opium produced.
   The Shah was not the only victim of the Committee of 300
William Buckley, CIA station chief in Beirut, in all his lack of
experience on who is behind the opium trade, began conducting
investigations in Iran, Lebanon and even spent time in Pakistan.
From Islamabad, Buckley began sending back damning reports
to the CIA in Langley about the burgeoning opium trade in the
Golden Crescent and Pakistan. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad
was firebombed, but Buckley escaped the mob attack and re-
turned to Washington because his cover was blown by forces
unknown.
  Then a very strange thing happened. Contrary to all proce-
dures laid down by the CIA when an agent's cover has been
blown, Buckley was sent back to Beirut. Buckley was in effect
sentenced to death by the CIA in order to silence him, and this
time the sentence was carried out. William Buckley was kidnaped
by agents of the Committee of 300. Under brutal interrogation
by  General  Mohammed el  Khouili of Syrian  intelligence to
force him to disclose the names of all field officers of the DEA
in  these  countries, he was brutally murdered. His efforts to

                              149

expose the huge opium trade developing out of Pakistan, Leba-
non and Iran cost Buckley his life.
   If the  remaining  free  men  in  this  world  believe  that
singlehandedly  or in  small  groups they can smash the  drug
trade, they are sorely mistaken. They could cut off the tentacles
of the opium and cocaine trade here and there, but never the
head. The crowned cobras of Europe and their Eastern Liberal
Establishment family will not tolerate it.  The war on drugs
which the Bush administration is allegedly fighting, but which it
is not, is for TOTAL legalization of ALL types and classes of
drugs. Such drugs are not solely a social aberration, but a full-
scale attempt to gain control of the minds of the people of this
planet, or as the "Aquarian Conspiracy" authors put it, "to bring
about radical  changes  in the  United  States."  THIS  IS  THE
PRINCIPAL TASK OF THE COMMITTEE OF 300, THE
ULTIMATE SECRET SOCIETY.
   Nothing has changed in the opium-heroin-cocaine trade. It
is still run by the same "upper class" families in Britain and the
United States. It is still a fabulously profitable trade where what
seem to be big losses through seizures by the authorities are
written off in paneled boardrooms in New York, Hong Kong and
London over port and cigars as "merely  the  cost  of doing
business, old boy."
   British colonial capitalism has always been the mainstay of
the oligarchical feudal system of privilege in England and remains
so to the present day. When the poor, untutored pastoral people
in South Africa who became known as the Boers fell into the
bloodstained hands of the British aristocracy in 1899, they had
no idea that the revoltingly cruel war so relentlessly pursued by
Queen  Victoria,  was  financed by  the  incredible  amounts  of
money which came from the "instant fortunes" of the BEIC
opium trade in China into the pockets of the plutocrats.
  Committee of 300 members Cecil John Rhodes, Barney
Barnato  and Alfred Beit instigated and engineered the war.
Rhodes was the principle agent for the Rothschilds, whose

                              150

banks were awash in cash flowing from the opium trade.
These robbers, thieves and liars--Rhodes, Barnato,
Oppenheimer, Joel and Beit--dispossessed the South African
Boers of their birthright, the gold and diamonds that lay beneath
their soil. The South African Boers received nothing out of the
BILLIONS UPON BILLIONS of dollars derived from the sale
of THEIR gold and diamonds.
   The Committee of 300 quickly took full control of these vast
treasures, control which it even now maintains through one of
its members, Sir Harry Oppenheimer. The average South African
receives $100 per annum per capita from the gold and diamond
industry. The BILLIONS which flow out annually go to the
bankers of the Committee of 300. It is one of the most foul and
vile  stories  of greed, theft and the murder of a nation ever
recorded in the annals of history.
   How could the British Crown have succeeded in pulling off
this stunning fraud of gigantic proportion? To accomplish such
a Herculean task requires skilled organizing with devoted agents-
in-place to carry out the daily instructions passed down from the
conspirators' hierarchy. The first step was a press propaganda
campaign portraying the Boers as uncivilized barbarians, only
slightly human, who were denying British citizens the right to
vote in the Boer Republic. Then, demands were made on Paul
Kruger, leader of the Transvaal Republic, which of course could
not  be  met. After that, a series of incidents were staged to
provoke the Boers into retaliation, but that didn't work either.
Then came the infamous Jameson Raid where a certain Jameson
led a party of several hundred armed men in an attack on the
transvaal. War followed immediately thereafter.
  Queen Victoria mounted the largest and best equipped army
that the world had ever seen at that time ( 1898). Victoria thought
he war would be over in two weeks, since the Boers had no
standing army and no trained militia and would be no match for
her 400,000  soldiers  drawn  from  the  ranks  of Britain's
underclasses.  The Boers  never numbered more than  80,000

                              151

farmers and their sons--some were as young as fourteen--
Rudyard Kipling also thought the war would be over in less than
a week.
   Instead, with rifle in one hand and the Bible in the other, the
Boers held out for three years. "We went to South Africa think-
ing the war would be over in a week," said Kipling. "Instead, the
Boers taught us no end of a lesson." That same "lesson" could
be taught to the Committee of 300 today if we could but muster
10,000 leaders, good men and true to lead this nation in battle
against the gargantuan monster threatening to devour everything
our Constitution stands for.
   After the war ended in  1902, the British Crown had to
consolidate its grip on the unimaginable fortune of gold and
diamonds that lay beneath the barren veldt of the Boer Repub-
lics of Transvaal and Orange Free State. This was done through
the Round Table of the legend of King Arthur and his Knights.
The Round Table is strictly a British M16 intelligence operation
established by the Committee of 300 which, together with the
Rhodes Scholarship program, is a dagger in the heartland of America.
   The Round Table was established in South Africa by Cecil
Rhodes and funded by the English Rothschild family. Its pur-
pose was to train business leaders loyal to the British Crown
who would secure the vast gold and diamond treasures for the
British Crown. South Africans had their birthright stolen from
them in a coup so massive and all pervading that it was apparent
only a central unified command could have pulled it off. That
unified command was the Committee of 300.
   That this was accomplished is not in dispute. By the early
1930's, the British Crown had a stranglehold on the biggest
supplies of gold and diamonds ever found in the world. NOW
THE COMMITTEE OF 300 HAD AT ITS DISPOSAL BOTH
THE VAST FORTUNE COMING FROM THE DRUG TRADE
AND THE EQUALLY VAST FORTUNE OF THE MINERAL
AND METAL WEALTH OF SOUTH AFRICA. Financial con-
trol of the world was complete.

                              152

   The  Round Table played a pivotal role in the coup. The
express purpose of the Round Table, after swallowing up South
Africa,  was to blunt the benefits to the United States of the
American War of Independence, and once more bring the United
States under British control. Organizing ability was essential for
such an enterprise and it was provided by Lord Alfred Milner,
protege of the London Rothschild family. Using Scottish Rite
Freemason principles in selecting members of Round Table,
chose chosen underwent a period of intense training at Cambridge
and Oxford Universities under the watchful eyes of John Ruskin,
a self-confessed "old school communist," and T. H. Green, an
operative of M16.
   It was Green, the son of a Christian evangelical cleric, who
spawned Rhodes, Milner, John Wheeler Bennet, A. D. Lindsay,
George Bernard Shaw and Hjalmar Schacht, Hitler's finance
minister. I pause here to remind readers that the Round Table is
only ONE SECTOR of this vast and all-encompassing Commit-
tee of 300. Yet the Round Table itself consists of a maze of
companies, institutions, banks and educational establishments,
which in itself would take qualified insurance actuaries a year to
sort out.
   Round Tablers  fanned  out throughout the  world  to  take
control of fiscal and monetary policies and political leadership
in all countries where they operated. In South Africa, General
Smuts, who had fought against the British in the Boer War, was
"turned" and became a leading British intelligence, military and
political agent who espoused the cause of the British Crown. In
the United States, in later years, the task of boring away at the
United States from the inside fell to William Yandell Elliot, the
man who spawned Henry Kissinger and who was responsible
for his meteoric rise to power as chief U.S. advisor to the
Committee of 300.
   William Yandell Elliot was "an American at Oxford," who
had  already  served the  Committee of 300  well,  which  is a
prerequisite for higher office in the service of the committee.

Conspirators' Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of 300", by
Dr. John Coleman, is reproduced here with the permission of the

                INSTITUTIONS THROUGH WHICH

                   CONTROL IS EXERCISED
                         (Cont.)

After graduating from Vanderbilt University in 1917, Elliot was
drafted by the Rothschild-Warburg banking network. He worked
at the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco and rose to be a
director. From there he acted as a Warburg-Rothschild intelli-
gence officer, reporting on the important areas of the United
States he was overseeing. Elliot's "Freemason" talent spotters
recommended him for a Rhodes Scholarship and, in 1923, he
went to Balliol College at Oxford University whose "dreaming
spires" hid a network of intrigue and future traitors to the West.
    Balliol College was, and still is, the center of recruiting for
the Round Table. After a thorough brainwashing conducted by
the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations representative, A.D.
Lindsay, who had succeeded Master of Balliol T. H. Green,
Elliot was received into the Round Table and sent to The Royal
Institute of International Affairs to be given his  assignment,
which was that he return to the United States to become a leader
in the academic community.
   The Round Table's driving philosophy was to have Round
Tablers in positions to formulate and carry out social policies
through  social  institutions  whereby  what Ruskin called  "the
masses" could be manipulated. Members infiltrated the highest
levels of banking  after under going a course at the Tavistock
Institute. The course was drawn up by Lord Leconsfield, an
intimate of the British royal family, and later run by Robert
Brand who went on to manage Lazard Freres. The Royal Insti-
tute of International Affairs was and remains totally interfaced
with the British monarchy.
   Some of the spinoffs of the Round Table are the Bilderbergers,
set up and run by Duncan Sandys, a prominent politician and
son-in-law of the late Winston Churchill, the Ditchley Founda-
tion, a secret banker's club which I exposed in my 1983 work,
"International Banker's Conspiracy: The Ditchley Foundation,"
the Trilateral Commission, the Atlantic Council of the United
States and the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, whose
well-hidden, behind the scenes founder was Lord Bullock of the

                              154

RIIA for whom Robert Anderson fronted.
   The way in which Henry Kissinger, the RllA's chief asset in
the United States, came to power is a story of the triumph of the
institution  of the British monarchy  over the Republic of the
United States of America. It is a tale of horror, too long to be
included here. Nevertheless, it would be remiss of me if I did not
mention just a few of the highlights of Kissinger's rise to fame,
fortune and power.
   After a stint in the United States Army, beginning with the job
of driving General Fritz Kraemer around war-torn Germany,
thanks to the Oppenheimer family Kissinger was picked to attend
Wilton Park for further training. At the time he held the rank of
private first class. In 1952 Kissinger was sent to the Tavistock
Institute where R. V. Dicks took him in hand and turned him
inside out. Thereafter there was no holding Kissinger back. He
was later drafted to serve under George Franklin and Hamilton
Fish of the Council on Foreign Relations' New York office.
   It is believed that the official nuclear policy adopted by the
United  States  was delivered to Kissinger during his stay at
Tavistock and further shaped by his participation in "Nuclear
Weapons and Foreign Policy," a Round Table seminar which
brought forth the doctrine known as "flexible response," a total
irrationality, which became known by the acronym MAD.
   Thanks to William Yandell Elliot and under the tutelage of
John Wheeler Bennett, top intelligence director of the Round
Table and chief of MI6 field operations in the United States,
Kissinger became Elliot's "favorite son" as he explained in his
book, "The Pragmatic Revolt in Politics." Kissinger was co-
opted  into  the  Round  Table to push monetarist policies he
studied at Harvard International Seminars.
   Kissinger avidly  absorbed Elliot's  teachings  and  was  no
longer recognizable as the man General Kraemer once described
as "my little Jew-boy driver." Kissinger was inculcated with the
spirit of the Master of Balliol, becoming an ardent disciple of
decadent  British  aristocracy.  Adopting  the  philosophies  of

                              155

Toynbee, chief intelligence director for MI6 at the Royal Insti-
tute of International Affairs, Kissinger used its papers to write
his undergraduate "dissertation."
  By the mid 1960's Kissinger had proved his worth to the
Round Table and the RIIA, and thus to the British monarchy. As
a reward and a test of what he had learned, Kissinger was placed
in charge of a small group consisting of James Schlessinger,
Alexander Haig and Daniel Ellsberg. The Round Table was
using to conduct a series of experiments. Cooperating with this
group  was the Institute of Policy Studies chief theoretician
Noam Chomsky.
   Haig, like Kissinger, worked for General Kraemer, albeit
not as a driver, and the general found a number of varied
openings in the Department of Defense for his protege. Once
Kissinger was installed as National Security Advisor, Kraemer
got Haig the job as his deputy. Ellsberg, Haig, and Kissinger
then set in motion the RIIA's Watergate plan to oust President
Nixon for disobeying direct instructions. Haig played the lead
role in brainwashing and confusing President Nixon, and in
effect it was Kissinger who ran the White House during this
softening up of the President. As I mentioned in 1984, Haig was
the White House go-between known as "Deep Throat," passing
information to the Washington Post team of Woodward and
Bernstein.
   The Watergating of Nixon was the biggest coup yet pulled
off by the Round Table as an agency and an arm of the RIIA. All
the tangled threads led back to the Round Table; from there to
the RIIA, and right back to the Queen of England. The humilia-
tion of Nixon was an object lesson and a warning to future
Presidents of the United States not to imagine they could go
against the Committee of 300 and win. Kennedy was brutally
murdered in full view of the American people for the same
reason; Nixon was not considered worthy enough to suffer the
same fate as John F. Kennedy.
   But whatever the method used, the Committee of 300 made

                              156

sure that all would-be aspirants for the White House got the
message:  "Nobody is beyond our reach." That this message
remains just as forceful as it was when Kennedy was murdered
and Nixon hounded out of office, is evidenced by the character
of President George Bush, whose eagerness to please his mas-
ters should be cause for grave concern among those who worry
about the future of the United States.
   The purpose of the exercise was made clear in the Pentagon
Papers episode and the drafting of Schlessinger into the Nixon
Administration to act as a spoiler in the defense establishment
and a counterforce to the development of atomic energy, which
role Schlessinger carried out from the shelter of his position in
the Atomic Energy Commission,  one of the key factors  in
deindustrializing the United States in the planned Club of Rome
Post Industrial-Zero-growth strategies. From this beginning we
can trace the roots of the 1991 recession/depression which has
thus far cost the jobs of 30 million Americans.
   It is virtually impossible to penetrate the Committee of 300
and the oligarchical families that go to make it up. The camou-
flage they pull over themselves as protective covering is very
hard to rip off. This fact should be noted by every freedom-
loving American: The Committee of 300 dictates what passes
for United States foreign and domestic policies and has done so
for over 200 years. Nowhere was this more strikingly portrayed
than when a cocky President Truman had the wind knocked out
of him by Churchill ramrodding the so-called "Truman Doctrine"
down the throat of the little man from Independence, Missouri.
   Some of their former members, whose descendants filled
vacancies caused by death, and present members include Sir
Mark Turner, Gerald Villiers, Samuel Montague, the Inchcapes,
Keswicks, Peases, Schroeders, Airlies, Churchills, Frasers, Lazars
and Jardine Mathesons. The full list of members is presented
elsewhere in this book; these people on the Committee OR-
DERED President Wilson to go to war against Germany in the
First World War; this Committee ordered Roosevelt to engineer

                              157

the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor with the object of getting
the United States into the Second World War.
   These people, this Committee, ordered this nation to war in
Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. The plain truth is that the
United States has fought in 5 wars this century for and on behalf
of the infamous Committee of 300. It seems that, apart from just
a few, no one has stopped to ask, "WHY ARE WE FIGHTING
THESE WARS?" The big drum of "patriotism," martial music
and waving flags and yellow ribbons, it seems, caused a great
nation to become bereft of its senses.
   On the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, a new "hate Japan"
campaign is being waged, not by the Institute of Pacific Relations
(IPR), but in the most direct and brazen manner by the Bush
Administration and the Congress. The object is the same as it
was when Roosevelt inspired the attack on Pearl Harbor, paint
the Japanese as aggressors and wage economic war, then ready
our forces for the next phase--armed aggression against Japan.
   This is already in the works; it is only a matter of time before
more of our sons and daughters are sent off to be slaughtered in
the service of the feudal lords of the Committee of 300. We
ought to shout from the housetops, "It is not for freedom nor for
love of country that we are going to die, but for a system of
tyranny that will shortly envelope the entire world."
   So tight is the grip of this organization on Britain that 95%
of British citizens have, since the 1700's, been forced to accept
as  their  share, less than 20% of the national wealth of the
country. This is what the oligarchical feudal lords of England
like to call "democracy." These nice, proper English gentlemen
are, in reality, utterly ruthless--what they did in India, Sudan,
Egypt, Iraq, Iran and Turkey will be repeated in every country
under the New World Order-One World Government. They will
use every nation and its wealth to protect their privileged way of
life. It is this class of British aristocracy whose fortunes are
inextricably  woven and intertwined with the drug trade, the
gold, diamond and arms trades, banking, commerce and industry,

                              158

oil, the news media and entertainment industry.
   Apart from the rank and file of the Labour Party (but not its
leaders), the majority of British political leaders are descendants
of titled families, the titles being hereditary and handed down
from father to eldest son. This system ensures that no "outside-
ers" aspire to political power in England. Nevertheless, some
aliens have been able to squeeze their way in.
   Take the case of Lord Halifax, former British Ambassador to
Washington and the man who delivered Committee of 300
orders to our government during the Second World War. Halifax's
son, Charles Wood, married a Miss Primrose, a blood relative of
Lord Rothschild. Behind such names as Lord Swaythling is
hidden the name of Montague, director of the Bank of England
and adviser and confidant of the majority stockholder of the
Shell Oil Company, Queen Elizabeth II. All are members of the
Committee of 300. Some of the old barriers have been broken
down. Title is today not the only criteria for admission to the
Club of Rome.
  It is appropriate to provide an overview of what the Com-
mittee of 300 hopes to achieve, what its aims and objectives are
before we proceed to its vast, far flung interlocking interfacing
of banks, insurance companies, corporations, etc. The following
information has taken years of investigative research to put together
from hundreds of documents and sources of mine who gave me
access to some of the papers in which the details are hidden.
   The Committee of 300 consists of certain individuals special-
ists in their own fields, including cultus diabolicus, mind altering
drugs, and specialists in murder by poison, intelligence; banking,
and every facet of commercial activity. It will be necessary to
mention former members since deceased, because of their former
roles and because their places were given to family members of
new members considered worthy of the honor.
  Included  in  the  membership  are the  old families  of the
European Black Nobility, the American Eastern Liberal Estab-
lishment (in Freemason hierarchy and the Order of Skull and

                              159


Bone), the Illuminati, or as it is known by the Committee
"MORIAH CONQUERING WIND," the Mumma Group, The
National and World Council of Churches, the Circle of Initiates,
the  Nine  Unknown  Men,  Lucis  Trust,  Jesuit Liberation
Theologists, The Order of the Elders of Zion, the Nasi Princes,
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank of International
Settlements (BIS), the United Nations (U.N.), the Central, British
Quator Coronati, Italian P2 Masonry--especially those in the
Vatican hierarchy--the Central Intelligence Agency, Tavistock
Institute selected personnel, various members of leading foun-
dations and insurance companies named in the lists that follow,
the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, the Milner Group-Round
Table,  Cini  Foundation,  German  Marshall  Fund,  Ditchley
Foundation, NATO, Club of Rome, Environmentalists, The Or-
der of St. John of Jerusalem, One World Government Church,
Socialist International, Black Order, Thule Society, Anenherbe-
Rosicrucianists, The Great Superior Ones and literally HUN-
DREDS of other organizations.
   What then are we looking at? A loosely-knit gathering of
people with weird ideas? Certainly not. In the Committee of 300,
which has a 150-year history, we have some of the most brilliant
intellects assembled to form a completely totalitarian, absolutely
controlled "new" society   only it isn't new, having drawn most
of its ideas from the Clubs of Cultus Diabolicus. It strives toward
a One World Government rather well described by one of its late
members, H. G. Wells, in his work commissioned by the Com-
mittee which Wells boldly called: "THE OPEN CONSPIRACY--
PLANS FOR A WORLD REVOLUTION."
   It was a bold statement of intent, but not really so bold since
nobody believed Wells  except the Great Superior Ones,  the
Anenherbes and those who were what we would call "insiders"
today. Here is an extract of what Wells proposed:

    "The Open Conspiracy will appear first, I believe as a
    conscious organization of intelligent, and in some cases

                              160

    wealthy men, as a movement having distinct social and
    political aims, confessedly ignoring most of the existing
    apparatus  of political  control,  or using  it  only  as  an
    incidental implement in the stages, a mere movement of
    a  number  of people  in  a  certain  direction,  who  will
    presently discover, with a sort of a surprise, the common
    object toward which they are all moving. In all sorts of
    ways, they will be influencing and controlling the os-
    tensible government."

   Like George Orwell's 1984, Wells'account is a mass-appeal
for a One World Government. Summarized, the intent and pur-
pose of the Committee of 300 is to bring to pass the following
conditions:
   A One World Government and one-unit monetary system
under permanent non-elected hereditary oligarchists who self
select from among their numbers in the form of a feudal system
as it was in the Middle Ages. In this One World entity, popula-
tion will be limited by restrictions on the number of children per
family, diseases, wars, famines, until 1 billion people who are
useful to the ruling class, in areas which will be strictly and
clearly defined, remain as the total world population.
   There will be no middle class, only rulers and servants. All
laws  will  be  uniform under  a  legal  system of world courts
practicing the same unified code of laws, backed up by a One
World Government police force and a One World unified military
to enforce laws in all former countries where no national bound-
aries shall exist. The system will be on the basis of a welfare state;
those who are obedient and subservient to the One World Gov-
ernment will be rewarded with the means to live; those who are
rebellious will simply be starved to death or be declared outlaws,
thus a target for anyone who wishes to kill them. Privately owned
firearms or weapons of any kind will be prohibited.
   Only one religion will be allowed and that will be in the
form of a One World Government Church, which has been in

                              161

existence since 1920 as we shall see. Satanism, Luciferianism
and Witchcraft shall he recognized as legitimate One World
Government curricula with no private or church schools. All
Christian churches have already been subverted and Christian-
ity will be a thing of the past in the One World Government.
   To induce a state where there is no individual freedom or
any concept of liberty surviving, there shall be no such thing as
republicanism, sovereignty or rights residing with the people.
National pride and racial identity shall be stamped out and in the
transition phase it shall be subject to the severest penalties to
even mention one's racial origin.
   Each person shall be fully indoctrinated that he or she is a
creature of the One World Government with an identification
number clearly  marked on their person  so  as  to  be readily
accessible, which identifying number shall be in the master file
of the NATO computer in Brussels, Belgium, subject to instant
retrieval by any agency of the One World Government at any
time. The master Files of the CIA, FBI, state and local police
agencies, IRS, FEMA, Social Security shall be vastly expanded
and form the basis of personal records of all individuals in the
United States.
   Marriage shall be outlawed and there shall be no family life
as we know it. Children will be removed from their parents at an
early-age and brought up by wards as state property. Such an
experiment  was  carried  out  in  East  Germany  under Erich
Honnecker when children were take away from parents consid-
ered by the state to be disloyal citizens. Women will he degraded
through the continued process of "women's liberation" move-
ments. Free sex shall be mandatory.
   Failure to comply at least once by the age of 20 shall be
punishable by severe reprisals against her person. Self-abortion
shall be taught and practiced after two children are born to a
woman; such records shall be contained in the personal file of
each woman in the One World Government's regional comput-
ers. If a woman falls pregnant after she has previously given

                              162

birth to two children, she shall be forcibly removed to an abor-
tion clinic for such an abortion and sterilization to be carried out
   Pornography shall be promoted and be compulsory showing
in every theater of cinema, including homosexual and lesbian
pornography. The use of "recreational" drugs shall be compul-
sory, with each person allotted drug quotas which can be pur-
chased at One World Government stores throughout the world.
Mind control drugs will be expanded and usage become com-
pulsory. Such mind control drugs shall be given in food and/or
water supplies  without the knowledge and/or consent of the
people. Drug bars shall be set up, run by One World Government
employees, where the slave-class shall be able to spend their
free time. In this manner the non-elite masses will be reduced to
the level and behavior of controlled animals with no will of their
own and easily regimented and controlled.
   The economic system shall be based upon the ruling oligar-
ethical  class  allowing  just enough  foods  and  services to be
produced to keep the mass slave labor camps going. All wealth
shall be aggregated in the hands of the elite members of the
Committee of 300. Each individual  shall be indoctrinated to
understand that he or she is totally dependent upon the state for
survival. The world shall be ruled by Committee of 300 Executive
Decrees which become instant law. Boris Yeltsin is using Com-
mittee of 300 decrees to impose the Committee's will on Russia
as a trial run. Courts of punishment and not courts of justice
shall exist.
   Industry is to be totally destroyed along with nuclear powered
energy systems. Only the Committee of 300 members and their
elitists  shall  have  the  right  to  any  of the  earth's  resources.
Agriculture shall be solely in the hands of the Committee of 300
with  food  production  strictly  controlled.  As  these  measures
begin to take effect, large populations in the cities shall be
forcibly removed to remote areas and those who refuse to go
shall be exterminated in the manner of the One World Govern-
ment experiment carried out by Pol Pot in Cambodia.

                              163

   Euthanasia for the terminally ill and the aged shall be com-
pulsory. No cities shall be larger than a predetermined number
as described in the work of Kalgeri. Essential workers will be
moved to other cities if the one they are in becomes overpopu-
lated. Other non-essential workers will be chosen at random and
sent to underpopulated cities to fill "quotas."
    At least 4 billion "useless eaters" shall be eliminated by the
year 2050 by means of limited wars, organized epidemics of
fatal  rapid-acting  diseases  and  starvation.  Energy,  food  and
water shall be kept at subsistence levels for the non-elite, start-
ing with the White populations of Western Europe and North
America and then spreading to other races. The population of
Canada, Western Europe and the United States will be decimated
more rapidly than on other continents, until the world's population
reaches a manageable level of 1 billion, of which 500 million
will consist of Chinese and Japanese races, selected because
they are people who have been regimented for centuries and
who are accustomed to obeying authority without question.
   From time to time there shall be artificially contrived food
and water shortages and medical care to remind the masses that
their very existence depends on the goodwill of the Committee
of 300.
   After the destruction of housing, auto, steel and heavy goods
industries, there shall he limited housing, and industries of any
kind allowed to remain shall be under the direction of NATO's
Club  of Rome  as  shall  all  scientific  and  space  exploration
development, limited to the elite under the control of the Com-
mittee of 300. Space weapons of all former nations shall be
destroyed along with nuclear weapons.
   All  essential  and  non-essential  pharmaceutical  products,
doctors, dentists and health care workers will be registered in
the central computer data bank and no medicine or medical care
will he prescribed without express permission of regional con-
trollers responsible for each city, town and village.
   The United States will be flooded by peoples of alien cultures

                              164

who will eventually overwhelm White America, people with no
concept of what the United States Constitution stands for and
who will, in consequence, do nothing to defend it, and in whose
minds the concept of liberty and justice is so weak as to matter
little. FOOD and shelter shall be the main concern.
   No central bank save the Bank of International Settlement
and the World Bank shall be allowed to operate. Private banks
will be outlawed. Remuneration for work performed shall be
under a uniform predetermined scale throughout the One World
Government. There shall be no wage disputes allowed, nor any
diversion from the standard uniform scales of pay laid down by
the One World Government. Those who break the law will be
instantly executed.
   There shall be no cash or coinage in the hands of the non-
elite. All transactions shall be carried out by means of a debit
card which shall bear the identification number of the holder.
Any person who in any way infringes the rules and regulations
of the Committee of 300 shall have the use of his or her card
suspended for varying times according to the nature and sever-
ity of the infringement.
   Such persons will find, when they go to make purchases,
that their card is blacklisted and they will not be able to obtain
services of any kind. Attempts to trade "old" coins, that is to say
silver coins of previous and now defunct nations, shall be treated
as a capital crime subject to the death penalty. All such coinage
shall be required to be surrendered within a given time along
with guns, rifles, explosives and automobiles. Only the elite and
One World Government high-ranking functionaries will be al-
lowed private transport, weapons, coinage and automobiles.
    If the offense is a serious one, the card will be seized at the
checking  point where  it is presented.  Thereafter that person
shall not be able to obtain food, water, shelter and employment
medical  services,  and  shall be  officially listed as an outlaw.
Large bands of outlaws will thus be created and they will live in
regions  that best afford subsistence,  subject to being hunted

                              165

down and shot on sight. Persons assisting outlaws in any way
whatsoever, shall likewise be shot. Outlaws who fail to surren-
der to the police or military after a declared period of time, shall
have a former family member selected at random to serve prison
terms in their stead.
   Rival  factions  and  groups  such  as  Arabs  and Jews  and
African tribes shall have differences magnified and allowed the
wage wars of extermination against each other under the eyes of
NATO and U.N. observers. The same tactics will be used in
Central and South America. These wars of attrition shall take
place BEFORE the take-over of the One World Government and
shall be engineered on every continent where large groups of
people with ethnic and religious differences live, such as the
Sikhs, Moslem Pakistanis and the Hindu Indians. Ethnic and
religious differences shall be magnified and exacerbated and
violent conflict as a means of "settling" their differences shall
be encouraged and fostered.
   All information services and print media shall be under the
control of the One World Government. Regular brainwashing
control measures shall be passed off as "entertainment" in the
manner in which it was practiced and became a fine art in the
United States. Youths removed from "disloyal parents," shall
receive special education designed to brutalize them. Youth of
both sexes shall receive training to qualify as prison guards for
the One World labor camp system.
   It is obvious from the foregoing that much work remains to
be done before the dawning of the New World Order can occur.
The Committee of 300 has long ago perfected plans to destabi-
lize civilization as we know it, some of which plans were made
known  by  Zbignew  Brzezinski  in  his  classic  work  "THE
TECHNOTRONIC ERA" and the works of Aurellio Peccei
who founded the Club of Rome, especially in his book, "THE
CHASM AHEAD."
   In "THE CHASM AHEAD," Peccei spelled out Committee
of 300 plans to tame man, whom he called "THE ENEMY."

                              166

Peccei quoted what Felix Dzerzinski once said to Sydney Reilly
at the height of the Red Terror when millions of Russians were
being murdered: "Why should I concern myself with how many
die? Even the Christian Bible says what is man that God should
be mindful of him? For me men are nothing but a brain at one
end and a shit factory at the other.  "
   It was from this brutish view of man that Emmanuel The
Christ came to rescue the world. Sydney Reilly was the MI6
operative sent to watch over Dzerzinski's activities. Reilly was
allegedly shot by his friend Felix while attempting to flee Rus-
sia. The elaborate plot was devised when certain members of the
British Parliament raised a hue and cry and began to loudly
demand an accounting of Reilly's activities in Russia, which
threatened to expose the role of the Committee of 300 in gaining
control of the Baku oilfields and its major role in assisting Lenin
and Trotsky during the Bolshevik Revolution. Rather than have
the truth dragged out of Reilly, MI6 thought it expedient to stage
his death. Reilly lived out his days in utter luxury in a Russia
villa usually reserved for the Bolshevik elite.
   Arguing that chaos would ensue unless the "Atlantic Alli-
ance," a euphemism for the Committee of 300 ruled post in-
dustrial America, Peccei proposed a Malthusian triaging on a
global scale. He envisioned a collision between the scientific-
technological-military apparatus of the Soviet Union and the
Western world. Thus the Warsaw Pact countries were to be
offered a convergence with the West in a One World Govern-
ment to run global affairs on the foundations of crisis manage-
ment and global planning.
   Events unfolding in what was formerly the USSR and the
emergence of several independent states in a loose federation in
Russia, is exactly what was envisaged by Peccei and the Club of
Rome and this is clearly spelled out in both the books I have
mentioned. A USSR thus divided will be easier to cope with
than a strong, united Soviet nation. Plans that were laid down by
the Committee of 300 for a One World Government, which

                              167

included the prospect of a divided Russia, are now approaching
a point of rapid escalation. Events in Russia at the close of 1991
are all the more dramatic when viewed against the 1960 long-
range planning by the Committee of 300.
   In Western Europe the people are working toward a federa-
tion of states within a one government framework with a single
currency. From there the EEC system will be transferred bit by
bit to the United States and Canada. The United Nations is benign
slowly but surely transformed into a rubber stamp of One World
Government, with policies dictated to it by the United States as
we saw in the case of the Gulf War.
   Precisely the same thing is happening with the British Par-
liament. Discussion on Britain's participation in the Gulf War
was  kept to  a ridiculously minimal level  and belatedly  took
place only during a motion to adjourn the House. This has never
happened before in the ancient history of parliament, where so
important a decision had to be made and so little time was
allowed for discussion. One of the most noteworthy events in
parliamentary history has gone virtually unnoticed.
   We are close to the point where the United States will send its
military Forces to settle any and all disputes brought before the
United Nations. Departing Secretary General Perez de Cuellar,
heavily laden with bribe money, was the most compliant U.N.
leader in history in granting demands of the United States without
discussion. His successor will be even more inclined to go along
with whatever the U.S. government places before him. This is an
important step along the road to a One World Government.
   The International Court of Justice at The Hague will be used
in increasing measure in the next two years to  settle legal
arguments of all types. It is of course the prototype for a One
World Government legal system that will supplant all others. As
for central banks, essential in the planning of the New World
Order, this is already very much a fait-accompli with the Bank
of International Settlements dominating the scene at the close of
1991. Private banks are fast disappearing in preparation for the

                              168

Big Ten banks that will control banking the world over under the
guidance of BIS and the IMF.
   Welfare states abound in Europe, and the United States is
fast  becoming  the  largest  welfare state in the world. Once
people come to depend on government for their subsistence, it
will be very hard to wean them away from it as we saw in the
results of the last mid-term election held in the United States
where 98% of incumbents were returned to Washington to enjoy
the good life in spite of their utterly deplorable records.
   The abolition of privately owned firearms is already in force
in three quarters of the world. Only in the United States can the
populace still own guns of all types, but that legal right is being
chipped away at an alarming rate by local and state laws which
violate  the  Constitutional right of all  citizens  to bear  arms.
Private gun ownership will have become a thing of the past in
the United States by the year 2010.
  SlMILARLY, EDUCATION IS BEING ERODED AT AN
ALARMING RATE. PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE BEING
FORCED TO CLOSE BY A VARIETY OF LEGAL STRATA-
GEMS AND LACK OF FUNDING. The standard of education
in the United States has already sunk to such a deplorable level
that today it can barely be classified as education at all. This is
according to plan; as I described earlier, the One World Gov-
ernment does not want our youth to be properly educated.
   Destruction  of national  identity  proceeds  apace.  It  is  no
longer a good thing to be patriotic   unless it is in the cause of
some One World Government project such as the war of geno-
cide being waged against the nation of Iraq, or the impending
destruction of Libya. Racial pride is now frowned upon and
deemed to be an illegal act in many parts of the world, IN-
CLUDING THE UNITED STATES, BRITAIN, WESTERN
EUROPE AND CANADA, ALL COUNTRIES HAVING THE
LARGEST CONCENTRATIONS OF THE WHITE RACE.
   Led by the secret societies in America, destruction of repub-
lican forms of government has proceeded apace since the close

                              169

of WW II. A list of such governments destroyed by the U.S. is 
long, and it is difficult for the non-informed to accept that
government of a country allegedly wedded to republicanism
under a unique constitution would engage in such conduct, but
the facts speak for themselves.
   This is a goal which was  set over a century ago by the
Committee of 300. The United States has led the attacks on such
governments and continues to do so even as the United States
republican base  is being  steadily undermined.  Starting  with
James Earl Carter's legal counsel, Lloyd Cutler, a committee of
constitutional lawyers has been working to change the U.S.
Congress into a non-representative parliamentary system. Work
has been in progress since  1979 on the blueprint for such a
change, and because of his devotion to the cause, Cutler was
made a member of the Committee of 300. The final draft for a
parliamentary  type of government is to be presented to the
Committee of 300 at the end of 1993.
   In the new parliamentary system, members will not be re-
sponsible to their constituents, but to parliamentary whips and
will vote the way they are told to vote. Thus, by judicial and
bureaucratic  subversion  will  the  Constitution  vanish  as  will
individual liberty. Preplanned degrading of man through licen-
tious sexual practices will be stepped up. New sexually degen-
erate cults are even now being set up by the British Crown--
working through the SIS and MI6 services. As we already know,
all cults operating in the world today are the product of British
intelligence acting for the oligarchical rulers.
   We may think this phase of creating a whole new cult which
specializes in sexual degenerate behavior is still far off, but my
information is that it is due to be stepped up in 1992. By 1994 it
will be quite commonplace to have "live shows" in the most
prestigious clubs and places of entertainment. This type of
"entertainment" is already in the process of having its image
cleaned and brightened.
   Soon the big names in Hollywood and the entertainment

                              170

world will be recommending this or that club as a "must" for
live  sex  shows.  Lesbianism  and  homosexuality  will  not  be
featured.  This  new  socially  acceptable  "entertainment"  will
consist of heterosexual displays and will be written up in reviews
as one finds in today's newspapers about shows on Broadway,
or the latest hit movie.
   An unprecedented assault on moral values will go into high
gear in 1992. Pornography will no longer be called "pornogra-
phy," but adult sex entertainment. Sloganeering will take the
form of "why hide it when everybody does it. Let's take away
the image that public displays of sex are ugly and dirty." No
more will those who care for this type of unbridled sexual lust
have to go to seedy porno parlours. Instead, the upper-class
supper clubs and places favored by the rich and famous will
make public sexual displays a highly "artistic" form of enter-
tainment. Worse yet, some church "leaders" will even recom-
mend it.
   The voluminous all-pervading and enormous  social psy-
chiatry apparatus put in place by the Tavistock Institute and its
huge web of related capabilities has been under the control of
one single entity, and that entity is still in control as we enter
1992. That single entity, the conspirators'hierarchy, is called
THE COMMITTEE OF 300. It is a power structure and a power
center that operates far beyond the reach of any single world
leader or any government, including the United States govern-
ment and its Presidents--as the late John F. Kennedy found out.
The Kennedy murder was an operation of the Committee of 300
and we shall return to that.
   The Committee of 300 is the ultimate secret society made up
of an untouchable ruling class, which includes the Queen of
England, the Queen of the Netherlands, the Queen of Denmark
and the royal families of Europe. These aristocrats decided at
the death of Queen Victoria, the matriarch of the Venetian Black
Guelphs that, in order to gain world-wide control, it would be
necessary for its aristocratic members to "go into business" with

                              171

the non-aristocratic but extremely powerful leaders of corporate
business on a global scale, and so the doors to ultimate power
were opened to what the Queen of England likes to refer to as
"the commoners."
   From my days in the intelligence business I know that heads
of foreign governments refer to this all-powerful body as "The
Magicians."  Stalin coined his  own phrase to describe them:
"The Dark Forces," and President Eisenhower, who was never
able to get beyond the "hofjuden" (court Jew) grade, referred to
it in a colossal understatement as "the military-industrial com-
plex." Stalin kept the USSR heavily armed with conventional
and nuclear forces because he did not trust what he called "the
family." His ingrained mistrust and fear of the Committee of
300 proved to be well-founded.
   Popular  entertainment,  especially  the  medium  of movie
making, was used to bring discredit upon those who tried to
warn of this most dangerous threat to individual liberty and
freedom of mankind. Freedom is a God-given law which man
has constantly sought to subvert and undermine; yet the yearn-
ing for freedom by each individual is so great that up to now, no
system has been able to tear that feeling from the heart of mad.
The experiments that have gone on in the USSR, Britain and the
USA, to blunt and dull mans yearnings for freedom, have thus
far proved to be unsuccessful.
   But with the coming of the New World Order-One World
Government,  far-reaching experiments  will be  stepped up to
drive mans God-given yearning for freedom out of his mind,
body and soul. What we are already experiencing is but nothing,
a mere bagatelle, when compared with what is to come. Attacking
the soul is the thrust of a host of experiments being readied, and
I regret to say that institutions in the United States will play a
leading role in the terrible experiments which have already been
carried out on local small-scale levels at such places as Bethesda
Naval Hospital and Vacaville prison in California.
   The movies we have seen thus far include the James Bond

                              172

series, the "Assassination Bureau," the "Matarese Circle" and
so on. They were make-believe movies, designed to hide the
truth that such organizations do exist and on a far greater scale
than even Hollywood's fertile idea-men could dream up.
    Yet the Assassination Bureau is absolutely real. It exists in
Europe and the United States solely to do the bidding of the
Committee of 300 to carry out high-level assassinations where
all other remedies have failed. It was PERMINDEX which ran
the Kennedy assassination under the direction of Sir William
Stephenson, for years the Queen of England's number one "pest
control" operative.
   Clay Shaw, a contract agent of the CIA, ran PERMINDEX
out of the Trade Mart Center in New Orleans. Former New
Orleans  District Attorney  Jim  Garrison  came very close to
cracking the Kennedy assassination plot up to the level of Clay
Shaw until Garrison was "dealt with" and Shaw was found not
quilty of involvement in the Kennedy assassination plot. The
fact that Shaw was eliminated in the manner of Jack Ruby,
another CIA contract agent--both died of induced quick-acting
cancer--speaks volumes that Garrison was on the right track.
   A second assassination bureau is located in Switzerland and
was until recently run by a shadowy figure of whom no photo-
graphs existed after 1941. The operations were and probably
still are financed by the Oltramaire family--Swiss Black Nobility,
owners of the Lombard  Odier Bank of Geneva, a Committee
of 300  operation.  The  primary  contact man  was  Jacques
Soustelle--this according to U.S. Army-G2 intelligence files.
   This group was also closely allied with Allen Dulles and
Jean de Menil, an important member of the Committee of 300
and a very prominent name in the oil industry in Texas. Army-
G2 records show that the group was heavily involved in the
arms trade in the Middle East, but more than that, the assassi-
nation  bureau  made  no  less  than  30  attempts  to  assassinate
General  de  Gaulle,  in  which Jacques  Soustelle  was  directly
involved.  The  same  Soustelle  was  the  contact man  for the

                              173

Sendero Luminosa-Shining Pathway guerilla group protecting
the Committee's Peruvian cocaine producers.
   When all of the best that the assassination bureau could do
had failed, thanks to the excellent work done by DGSE (French
intelligence-formerly SDECE) the job was assigned to MI6--
Military Intelligence Department Six, and also known as Secret
Intelligence Service (SIS), under the code name "Jackal." SDECE
employed clever young graduates and was not infiltrated by
MI6 or the KGB to any measurable extent. Its record in tracking
down foreign agents made it the envy of the secret services of
every nation, and it was this group that followed "Jackal" to his
final destination and then killed him before he could fire on
General de Gaulle's motorcade.
   It was the SDECE who uncovered a Soviet mole in the
cabinet of De Gaulle, who also happened to be a liaison man
with the CIA in Langley. In order to discredit the SDECE, Allen
Dulles, who hated De Gaulle, (the feeling was mutual) had one
of its agents, Roger De Louette, caught with $12 million worth
of heroin in his possession. After a great deal of expert "interro-
gation," De Louette "confessed" but was unable to say why he
was smuggling drugs into the United States. The whole thing
stank to high heaven of a set-up.
   Based upon an examination of SDECE methods in protect-
ing De Gaulle, especially in motorcades, the FBI, Secret Service
and the CIA knew exactly how to strip President Kennedy of his
security and make it easy for the three PERMINDEX shooters
to murder him in Dealey Plaza in November 1963.
   Another example of FACT disguised as fiction is the Leon
Uris novel, "TOPAZ." In "TOPAZ" we find a factual account of
the activities of Thyraud de Vosjoli, the very KGB agent un-
covered by SDECE and denounced as the KGB's liaison man
with the CIA. There are many fictionalized accounts of the 
MOSSAD's activities, nearly all of which are based on fact.
   The MOSSAD  is  also known  as  "The Institute."  Many
would-be writers make nonsensical statements about it, especially

                              174

one writer who is much in favor with the Christian right wing,
which is accepted as truth. One can pardon the offender because
he has no intelligence training, but that does not stop him from
dropping "Mossad names" all over the place.
   Such  disinformation  exercises  are  routinely  run  against
American right wing patriotic groups. Originally the MOSSAD
consisted of 3 groups, the Bureau of Military Intelligence, the
Political Department of the Foreign Office and the Department
of Security (Sherut Habitachon). David Ben Gurion, a member
of the Committee of 300, received some considerable help from
MI6 in putting it together.
   But it was not a success, and in 1951 Sir William Stephenson
of MI6 restructured it into a single unit as arm of the Political
Department of the Israeli Foreign Office, with a special operations
group for espionage and "black job" operations. British intelli-
gence  gave further  assistance  in  training  and  equipping  for
servicing the Sarayet Maktal, also known as the General Staff
Reconnaissance unit, in the format of Britain's Special Air
Service (SAS).  This  service unit of the MOSSAD is  never
mentioned by name and is known simply as "The Guys."
    "The Guys" are merely an extension of British intelligence's
SAS unit who continually train and update them in new meth-
ods. It was "The Guys" who killed the leaders of the P.L.0. and
kidnaped Adolph Eichmann.  "The Guys"  and indeed  ALL
MOSSAD agents, operate on a war-time footing. The MOSSAD
has a tremendous advantage over other intelligence services in
that every country in the world has a large Jewish community.
   By studying social and criminal records, the MOSSAD is
able to pick agents among local Jews it can have a hold over
AND MAKE THEM WORK FOR IT WITHOUT PAY. The
MOSSAD also has the advantage of having access to the records
of all  U.S.  law  enforcement  agencies  and  U.S.  intelligence
services The Office of Naval Intelligence (OM) ELINT services
the Mossad at no cost to Israel. Citizens of the United States
would  be  shocked,  angered  and  dismayed  if ever  it  was

                              175

discovered just how much the MOSSAD knows about the lives
of millions of Americans in every walk of life, even those who
are not political in any way.
  The first head of the MOSSAD, Reuben Shiloach, was made
a member of the Committee of 300, but it is not known whether
his successor enjoyed the same privilege. Chances are that he
does. The MOSSAD has a skillful disinformation service. The
amount of disinformation it feeds to the American "market" is
embarrassing, but even more embarrassing is how it is swal-
lowed hook, line and sinker and all.
   What we are actually witnessing in the microcosm of the
MOSSAD is the extent of control exercised by the "Olympians"
over the intelligence services, entertainment, publishing, opin-
ion-making (polls) and the television "news" media on a global
scale. Ted Turner was recently given a seat on the Committee of
300 in recognition for his "news" (making) CNN broadcasts. The
Committee has the power and the means to tell the people of this
world ANYTHING, and it will be believed by the vast majority,
   On every occasion that a researcher happens upon this as-
tounding central control group, he is either successfully bought
off,  or  else  he  undergoes some "speciality training" at the
Tavistock Institute after which he becomes  a contributor to
more fiction, of the James Bond type, i.e., he is derailed and
well rewarded. If such a person as John F. Kennedy  should
stumble  onto  the truth  about who directs  world events,  and
cannot be bought, he is assassinated.
   In the case of John F. Kennedy, the assassination was carried
out with great attendant publicity and with the utmost brutality
to serve as a warning to world leaders not to get out of line. Pope
John Paul I was quietly murdered because he was getting close
to the Committee of 300 through Freemasons in the Vatican
hierarchy. His successor, Pope John Paul 11, was publicly hu-
miliated as a warning to cease and desist--which he has done.
As we shall see, certain Vatican leaders are today seated on the
Committee of 300.

                              176

   It is  easy to put serious researcher off track of the
Committee of 300 because Britain's MI6 (SAS) promotes a
wide variety of kookery such as the New Age, Yogaism, Zen
Buddhism, Witchcraft, Delphic Priesthood of Apollo (Aristotle
was a member) and hundreds of small "cults" of all kinds. A
group of "retired" British intelligence agents who stayed on the
track labeled the conspirators'hierarchy "Force X," and declared
that it possesses a super-intelligence service that has corrupted
the KGB, the Vatican Intelligence, the CIA, the ONI, DGSE,
U.S.  military  intelligence,  the  State  Department  intelligence
service and even the most secret of all U.S. intelligence agen-
cies, the Office of National Reconnaissance.
   The existence of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO)
was known to only a handful of people outside of the Commit-
tee of 300, until Truman stumbled upon it quite by accident.
Churchill had a hand in setting up the NRO and he was report-
edly  livid when Truman  discovered its  existence.  Churchill
more than any other servant of the Committee of 300, consid-
ered Truman His-Little-Man from independence "without an
independence at all." This referred to Truman's every move
being controlled by Freemasonry. Even today, NRO's annual
budget is not known to the Congress of the United States, and it
is responsible to only a selected few in Congress. But it is a
creature  of the  Committee of 300 to whom its reports  are
routinely sent every few hours.

--- Committee of 300 - Part 8 ------------------------------------------



   Thus  the fictionalized spoofs one  sees about the various
branches and arms of control of the Committee were designed
to take suspicion away from the real thing, but we should never
doubt that the real thing does indeed exist. Take another example
of what I mean, the book "THE DAY OF THE JACKAL," from
which a highly successful movie was created.
   The  events  related in  the book are factual. Although for
obvious  reasons the names  of some of the players  and the
locales were changed, but the thrust of the story, that a single
MI6 operative was assigned to get rid of General Charles De

                              177

Gaulle, is absolutely correct. General De Gaulle had become
unmanageable, refusing to cooperate with the Committee--
whose existence he knew very well since he had been invited to
join it--came to a climax when De Gaulle withdrew France
from NATO and immediately began building his own nuclear
force--the so-called "force de frappe." 
    This so angered the Committee that De Gaulle's assassination
was ordered. But the French secret intelligence service was able
to intercept "Jackal's" plans and keep De Gaulle safe. In the
light of the record of MI6, which I might add is the Committee
of 300's main resource when it comes to intelligence, the work
done by French intelligence borders on the miraculous.
   Military Intelligence Department Six dates back to Sir Francis
Walsingham, paymaster of Queen Elizabeth I for dirty tricks
operations. Over hundreds of years, MI6 has established a record
which no other intelligence agency can come near to duplicating.
MI6 agents have gathered information from the four corners of
the earth and have carried out secret operations that would
astound even the most knowledgeable if ever they were to be
made public, which is why it rates as the Master service of the
Committee of 300.
    Officially, MI6 does not exist, its budget comes out of the
Queen's purse and "private funds," and is reported to be in a
range of $350-$500 million per annum, but no one knows for sure
what the exact amount is. In its present form MI6 dates back to
1911, when it was under the leadership of Sir Mansfield Cumming,
a captain in the Royal Navy, who was always identified by the
letter "C," from which "M" of James Bond fame is taken.
    No official record of MI6's failures and successes exist--it
is that secret, although the Burgess-Maclean-Blake-Blunt disas-
ters  did great damage to the morale of MI6 officers.  Unlike
other services, future members are recruited from universities
and other areas of learning by highly skilled "talent scouts" as
we saw in the case of Rhodes Scholars inducted into the Round
Table.  One of the requirements is  an ability to  speak foreign

                              178

languages. Candidates undergo a rigorous "blooding."
   With the backing of such a formidable force, the Committee
of 300 had little fear from ever being exposed, and this will go
on for decades. What makes the Committee incredible is the
incredible secrecy that prevails. None of the news media has
ever made mention of this conspiratorial hierarchy; therefore, as
is to be expected, people doubt its existence.
   The Committee of 300 is for the most part under the control
of the British monarch, in this case, Elizabeth II. Queen Victoria
is believed to have been quite paranoid about keeping it secret
and went to great lengths to cover up MASONIC writings left at
the scene of "Jack the Ripper" murders which alluded to the
Committee of 300's connections with "experiments" carried out
by a family member who was also a highly-placed member of
the  Scottish Rite of Freemasonry.  The Committee of 300 is
filled with members of British aristocracy which has corporate
interests and associates in every country of the world, including
the USSR.
   The Committee's structure is as follows:
   The Tavistock Institute at Sussex University and London
sites is owned and controlled by the Royal Institute for Interna-
tional Affairs whose "hofjuden" in America is Henry Kissinger.
The EAGLE STAR GROUP, which changed its name to the
STAR GROUP after the close of the Second World War, is
composed of a group of major international companies involved
in overlapping and interfaced areas (1) Insurance, (2) Banking,
(3) Real Estate, (4) Entertainment, (5) High technology, including
cybernetics, electronic communications, etc.
   Banking, while not the mainstay, is vitally important, espe-
cially in the areas where banks act as clearing houses and money
launderers of drug money. The main "big name banks" are The
Bank of England, the Federal Reserve Banks, Bank of Interna-
tional Settlements, the World Bank and the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Bank. American Express Bank is a means of recycling
drug dollars. Each of these banks is affiliated with and/or con-

                              179

trols hundreds of thousands of large and small banks throughout
the world.
   Banks large and small in the thousands are in the Committee
of 300 network, including Banca Commerciale d'Italia, Banca
Privata, Banco Ambrosiano, the Netherlands Bank, Barclays
Bank, Banco del Colombia, Banco de Ibero-America. Of spe-
cial interest is Banca del la Svizzeria Italiana (BSI)--since it
handles flight capital investments to and from the United States--
primarily in dollars and U.S. bonds--located and isolated in
"neutral"  Lugano,  the flight capital center for the Venetian
Black Nobility. Lugano is not in Italy or in Switzerland, and is a
kind of a twilight zone for  shady flight capital  operations.
George Ball, who owns a large block of stock in BSI, is a
prominent "insider" and the hank's U.S. representative.
   BCCI, BNL, Banco Mercantil de Mexico, Banco Nacional
de Panama, Bangkok Metropolitan Bank, Bank Leumi, Bank
Hapoalim, Standard Bank, Bank of Geneva, Bank of Ireland,
Bank of Scotland, Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia,
Banque Paris et Pays Bas, British Bank of the Middle East and
the Royal Bank of Canada to name but a very small number in a
huge list of "speciality" banks.
   The Oppenheimers of South Africa are much bigger "heavy-
weights"  than  the Rockefellers.  For instance, in 1981 Harry
Oppenheimer, chairman of the giant Anglo American Corpora-
tion that controls gold and diamond mining, sales and distribu-
tion in the world, stated that he was about to launch into the
North American banking market. Oppenheimer promptly in-
vested $10 billion in a specially created vehicle for the purpose
of buying into big banks in the U.S., among which was Citicorp.
Oppenheimer's investment vehicle was called Minorco, which
set up shop in Bermuda, a British royal family preserve. On the
board of Minorco was to be found Walter Wriston of Citicorp
and Robert Clare, its chief counsel.
   The only other company to rival Oppenheimer in the field of
precious metals and minerals was Consolidated Gold Fields of

                              180

South Africa, but Oppenheimer took control of it with a 28%
stake   the  largest  single  stockholder.  Thus  gold,  diamonds,
platinum, titanium, tantalite, copper, iron ore, uranium and 52
other metals and minerals, many of them of absolutely vital
strategic value to United States, passed into the hands of the
Committee of 300.
   Thus  was the vision of one of the earlier South African
members of the Committee of 300, Cecil John Rhodes, fully
realized, a vision which started with the spilling of the blood of
thousands upon thousands of White farmers and their families
in South Africa, whom history records as the "Boers." While the
United States stood by with folded hands as did the rest of the
world, this small nation was subjected to the most vicious war
of genocide in history. The United States will be subjected to the
same treatment by the Committee of 300 when our turn comes
and it will not be long in coming.
   Insurance companies play a key role in the business of the
Committee of 300. Among these are found such top insurance
companies as Assicurazioni Generali of Venice and Riunione
Adriatica di Sicurta, the largest and second largest insurance
companies in the world, who keep their bank accounts at Bank
of International Settlements in Swiss gold francs. Both control a
multiplicity of investment banks whose turnover in stocks on
Wall Street double that of U.S. investors.
  Prominent on the board of these two insurance giants are
Committee of 300 members: the Giustiniani family, Black No-
bility of Rome and Venice who trace their lineage to the Emperor
Justianian; Sir Jocelyn Hambro of Hambros (Merchant) Bank;
Pierpaolo Luzzatti Fequiz, whose lineage dates back six centu-
ries to the most ancient Luzzatos, the Black Nobility of Venice,
and Umberto Ortolani of the ancient Black Nobility family of
the same name.
   Other old Venetian Black Nobility Committee of 300 mem-
bers and board members of ASG and RAS are the Doria family,
the financiers of the Spanish Hapsburgs, Elie de Rothschild of the

                              181

French Rothschild family, Baron August von Finck (Finck, the
second richest man in Germany is now deceased), Franco Orsini
Bonacassi of the ancient Orsini Black Nobility that traces its
lineage to an ancient Roman senator of the same name, the Alba
family whose lineage dates back to the great Duke of Alba, and
Baron Pierre Lambert, a cousin of the Belgian Rothschild family.
   The English companies controlled by the British royal fam-
ily are Eagle Star, Prudential Assurance Company, the Pruden-
tial Insurance Company, which own and control most American
insurers, including Allstate Insurance. At the head of the list is
Eagle Star, probably the most powerful "front" for Military
Intelligence Department Six (MI6). Eagle Star, although nowhere
near  as  large  as Assicurazioni  Generale,  is  perhaps  equally
important simply because it is owned by members of the Queen
of England's family and, as titular head of the Committee of
300, Eagle Star makes a tremendous impact.
   Eagle Star is more than a major "front" for MI6, it is also a
Front for major British banks, including Hill-Samuels, N. M.
Rothschild and Sons (one of the gold price "fixers" who meet
daily in London), and Barclays Bank (one of the funders of the
African National Congress-ANC). It can be said with a great
degree of accuracy that the most powerful British oligarchical
families created Eagle Star as a vehicle for "black operations"
against those who oppose Committee of 300 policies.
   Unlike the CIA, British law makes it a serious crime to name
MI6 officials, so the following is but a partial list of "top brass"
of MI6, who are (or were) also members of the Committee of 300:
      Lord Hartley Shawcross.
      Sir Brian Edward Mountain.
      Sir Kenneth Keith.
      Sir Kenneth Strong.
      Sir William Stephenson.
      Sir William Wiseman.
   All of the fore going are (or were) heavily involved in key
Committee  of 300  companies  which interface  with  literally

                              182

thousands of companies engaged in every branch of commercial
activity as we shall see.
   Some of these companies include Rank Organization, Xerox
Corporation, ITT, IBM, RCA, CBS, NBC, BBC and CBC in
communications, Raytheon, Textron, Bendix, Atlantic Richfield,
British Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, Marine Midland Bank,
Lehman Brothers, Kuhn Loeb, General Electric, Westinghouse
Corporation, United Fruit Company and a great many more.
   MI6 ran a large number of these companies through British
intelligence stationed in the RCA building in New York, which
was the headquarters of its chief officer, Sir William Stephenson.
Radio Corporation of America (RCA) was formed by G.E.,
Westinghouse,  Morgan  Guarantee  and Trust  (acting  for  the
British crown), and United Fruit, back in  1919 as a British
intelligence center.  RCA's  first president was  J.P.  Morgan's
Owen Young, after whom the Young Plan was named. In 1929
David Sarnoff was appointed to run RCA. Sarnoff had acted as an
assistant to Young at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference where a
fallen Germany was stabbed in the back by the victorious "allies."
   A network of Wall Street banks and brokerage houses takes
care of the stock market for the Committee, and prominent
among these are Blyth, Eastman Dillon, the Morgan groups,
Lazard Freres and Kuhn Loeb Rhodes. Nothing happens on
Wall Street that is not controlled by the Bank of England, whose
instructions are relayed through the Morgan groups
and then put into action through key brokerage houses whose top executives
are ultimately responsible for carrying out Committee directives.
  Before it overstepped the limits laid down by Morgan Guar-
antee, Drexel Burnham Lambert was a favorite of the Commit-
tee of 300. In 1981 almost every major brokerage house on Wall
Street had  sold  out to  the  Committee,  Phibro  merging  with
Salomon  Brothers.  Phibro  is  the  business  arm  of the
Oppenheimers of Anglo American Corporation. By this control
mechanism, the Committee of 300 ensures that its members and
their far-flung business corporations turned their investments on

                              183

Wall Street over at a rate of double that of the "non-insider"
foreign investors.
   Remember, some of the richest families in the world live in
Europe, so it is natural that they should have a preponderance of
members on the Committee. The Von Thurn und Taxis family
who once owned the German postal franchise, make David
Rockefeller look like a very poor relation. The Von Thurn und
Taxis dynasty dates back 300 years and generation after gen-
eration of family members have had seats on the Committee
which they occupy to this day. We have already mentioned by
name many of the most wealthy Venetian Black Nobility mem-
bers of the Committee of 300 and other names will be added as
we come across them in their various fields of endeavor. Now
we shall include some American members of the Committee of
300 and try to trace their affiliations and connections to the
British Crown.
   How can these facts be verified? Actually, some of them
cannot be verified because the information comes straight out of
intelligence files, but with  a lot of legwork,  there  are  many
sources which can verify at least part of the facts.  The work
would involve a diligent search of Dun and Bradstreet Refer-
ence Book of Corporations, Standard and Poors, British and
American "Who's Who" with long hours of hard work in cross-
referencing names with their corporate affiliations.
   Committee of 300 corporations, banks, and insurance com-
panies operate under the unified command covering every con-
ceivable matter of strategy and cohesive action. The Committee
is the ONLY organized power hierarchy in the world transcend-
ing all governments and individuals, however powerful and
secure they may feel themselves to be.  This covers finance,
defense matters and political parties of all colors and types.
   There is no entity the Committee cannot reach and control,
and that includes organized religions of the world. This then, is
the all powerful OLYMPIAN GROUP whose power base is in
London and the City of London's financial centers with its grip

                              184

on minerals, metals  and precious gems, cocaine,  opium and
pharmaceutical drugs, rentier-financier bankers, cult promoters
and founders of rock music. The British Crown is the control
point from which all things radiate. As the saying goes, "They
have a finger in every pie."
   It is obvious that the communications field is tightly con-
trolled.  Going  back  to RCA, we find that its directorate is
composed of British-American establishment figures who feature
prominently in other organizations such as the CFR, NATO, the
Club of Rome, the Trilateral Commission, Freemasonry, Skull
and Bones, Bilderbergers, Round Table, Milner Society and the
Jesuits-Aristotle Society. Among them was David Sarnoff who
moved to London at the same time Sir William Stephenson
moved into the RCA building in New York.
   All three major television networks came as spinoffs from
RCA, especially the National Broadcasting Company (NBC)
which was first, closely followed by the American Broadcasting
Company (ABC) in 1951. The third big television network was
Columbia Broadcasting  System  (CBS)  which,  like its  sister
companies was, and still is, dominated by British intelligence.
William Paley was trained in mass brainwashing techniques at the
Tavistock Institute prior to being passed as qualified to head CBS.
   Thus, if we the people of the United States but knew it, all
our major television networks are subject to British oversight,
and information they provide first goes to London for clearance.
It is  interesting to  note that the Tavistock intelligence paper
written by Stanford Research Institute, commonly named "The
Aquarian Conspiracy" was funded by donations from all three
major television networks.
   All three major networks are represented on the Committee
of 300 and are affiliated with the giant of the mass communica-
tion business, the Xerox Corporation of Rochester, New York,
whose Robert M. Beck holds a seat on the Committee. Beck is also
a director of the Prudential Life Insurance Company, which is a
subsidiary of the London Prudential Assurance Company Limited.

                              185

  Others on the board of Xerox are Howard Clark of the
American Express Company, one of the main conduits for mov-
ing drug money through "travelers checks," former Secretary of
the Treasury, William Simon, and Sol Linowitz, who negotiated
the Panama Canal Treaties for the Committee. Linowitz is im-
portant to the Committee by virtue of his long standing expertise
in laundering drug money through Marine Midland and the
Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank.
   Another Xerox board member is Robert Sproull, who is of
real interest because, as president of the University of Rochester,
he allowed the Tavistock Institute, working through the CIA, to
use the university's facilities for the 20-year MK-Ultra LSD
experiments. Some 85 other universities in the U.S. also allowed
their facilities to be misused in this manner. As giant-sized as
Xerox is, it is dwarfed by the Rank Organization, a London-
based  conglomerate  fully  controlled  by  members  of Queen
Elizabeth's immediate family.
   Notable members of the board of Rank Organization who
are also members of the Committee of 300 are the following:
   Lord Helsby, chairman of the drug money clearing house,
Midland Bank. Helsby's other positions include a directorship
in the giant Imperial Group and the Industrial and Commercial
Finance Corporation.
   Sir Arnold France, a director of Tube Investments who runs
the London underground train service. France is also a director
of the BANK OF ENGLAND which has so much control over
the Federal Reserve Banks.
   Sir Dennis Mountain, chairman of the mighty Eagle Star
group  and  a director of English Property  Corp,  one  of the
rentier-financier  companies  of the  British  royal  family.  One
such member is the Honorable Angus Ogilvie, "Prince of Com-
panies," who is married to Her Royal Highness Princess Alex-
andria, sister of the Duke of Kent, leader of the Scottish Rite of
Freemasonry and who takes the place of the Queen when she is
outside of Britain. Ogilvie is a director of the Bank of England

                              186

and  chairman  of the  giant LONRHO  conglomerate.  It  was
LONRHO that ended the rule of Ian Smith in Rhodesia so that
he could be replaced by Robert Mugabe. At stake was Rhodesia's
chrome mines which produce the finest high-grade chrome ore
in the world.
   Cyril Hamilton, chairman of the Standard and Chartered
Bank (the old Lord Milner-Cecil Rhodes bank) and a board
member of the Bank of England. Hamilton is also on the board
of the Xerox Corporation, the Malta International Banking Cor-
poration (A Knights of Malta bank), a director of the Standard
Bank of South Africa--the largest bank in that country, and a
director of the Banque Belge d'Afrique.
  Lord O'Brien of Lotherby, past president of the British Bankers
Association, director of Morgan Grenfell--a powerful bank, direc-
tor of Prudential Assurance, director of J. P.Morgan, director of the
Bank of England, a board member of the Bank of International
Settlements, a director of the giant Unilever conglomerate.
  Sir Reay Geddes, chairman of the giant Dunlop and Pirelli
tyre companies, director of the Midland and International Banks,
director of the Bank of England. Note how many of these
powerful men  are  directors  of the Bank of England which
makes control of American fiscal policies simple.
   Many of these organizations  and institutions,  companies
and banks are so interfaced and interlocked as to make it an
almost impossible task to sort them out. On RCA's board sits
Thornton Bradshaw, president of Atlantic Richfield and a member
of NATO, World Wildlife Fund, the Club of Rome, The Aspen
Institute for Humanistic Studies, the Council on Foreign Rela-
tions. Bradshaw is also chairman of NBC. The most important
function of RCA remains its service to British intelligence.
   It is not generally known how powerful was the role played
by the Committee of 300 in stopping the investigation into the
CIA which Senator McCarthy almost succeeded in pulling off.
Had McCarthy been successful, it is very likely that President
John F. Kennedy would be alive today.

                              187

   When McCarthy said he was going to summon William
Bundy to appear before his commission of enquiry, panic swept
Washington and London. Bundy, had he been called to testify,
would most probably have cracked and opened the door to the
"special  relations" that existed between British oligarchical
circles and their cousins in the United States Government.
   Such a possibility could not be entertained. The Royal In-
sititute of International Affairs  was called in to put an end to
McCarthy. The RIIA chose Allen Dulles, a man who was totally
enamored of decadent British society, to attack McCarthy head
on. Dulles put Patrick Lyman and Richard Helms in charge of
the McCarthy case. Helms was later rewarded for his service
against McCarthy by being made head of the CIA.
   General Mark Clark, a member of the CFR and a well-liked
military  man  in  London  circles, was appointed by General
Eisenhower to turn back McCarthy's full-fledged attack on the
CIA. McCarthy was preempted when Clark announced that a
special committee was to be appointed to examine the agency.
Clark, on instructions from the RIIA, recommended a Congres-
sional watchdog committee to "periodically examine the work
of government intelligence agencies." The whole thing was a
super tragedy for America and a victory for the British, who
feared  that  McCarthy  would accidentally stumble onto the
Committee of 300 and its control over every aspect of United
States affairs.
   Lehman  Brothers-Kuhn  Loeb's  former  chairman,  Peter
G.Peterson, served under former MI6 chief Sir William Wiseman
and as such was no stranger to British royalty. Peterson is tied in
with Aspen Institute, yet another arm of British intelligence.
   John  R.  Petty  is  president  and  chairman  of the  Marine
Midland Bank--a bank whose drug trade connections have
been well established long before it was taken over by the Hong
Kong and Shanghai Bank, probably the number one bank in the
opium trade, a position it has held since 1814.
   But the best proof I can offer of the existence of the Com-

                              188

mittee of 300 is the Rank Organization which, in conjunction
with Eagle Star, IS THE BRITISH CROWN. It is also the black
operations center of MI6 (SIS). Between them, these two Com-
mittee of 300 companies control Her Majesty's Dominion of
Canada, using the "hofjuden" Bronfman family to carry out
their orders.
   Trizec Holdings, ostensibly owned by the Bronfman family,
is in reality the main asset of the Queen of England's in Canada.
The  entire  Southeast Asian  opium  trade interfaces with the
Bronfman empire and is one of the means whereby heroin is
brought to America. In a sense, Canada is like Switzerland
pristine snow-covered landscapes, big cities, a place of great
beauty, but underneath lies a deep layer of filth and dirt arising
from its massive heroin trade.
   The Bronfman family are "cut-outs"'what is known in MI6
as "front men"   controlled from London by MI6 "deskmen,"
intelligence  jargon  for  controllers  at  headquarters.  Edgar
Bronfman, the family leader, was sent to "Moscow Center"--
cover name for the KGB headquarters at 2 Dzerzhinsky Square,
Moscow, on a large number of occasions.
   At a low level, Bronfman was probably very useful as a
contact man with Moscow. Bronfman was never at any stage a
contract agent for MI6 and so never carried the title "Paroles," a
key intelligence word for mutual identification between agents,
which greatly disappointed the eager Bronfman family head. At
one stage when it was thought that some of the family were
acting suspiciously, "watchers"--intelligence jargon for intelli-
gence officers keeping persons under surveillance, were put on
the Bronfman family, but found only that one of the Bronfmans
had been bragging to a United States "cousin" (the word MI6
uses for the C.I.A.)  who was unaware of the role of Edgar
Bronfman. This was quickly corrected.
   Two Eagle Star directors, who were also the two top MI6
operatives, took control of the Bronfman family about six months
after the war ended. Sir Kenneth Keith and Sir Kenneth Strong,

                              189

whom we have already met, legitimated the Bronfman family
by setting up Trizec Holdings. There is no one in the world who
can do a better job of "fronting," through companies, than MI6
   Yet, like Switzerland, there is a dirty side to Canada that has
been well-hidden from view by the Committee of 300 under
cover of the Official Secrets Act, a carbon-copy of the British
law passed in 1913. Drugs, dirty money laundering, crime and
racketeering are all covered by their infamous Act.
   Not known to many is that, if charged under the Official
Secrets Act, which can be interpreted any way the Crown agents
choose, persons could face the death penalty. As I have said so
many times since 1980, Canada is not a nation like South Africa,
or Holland or Belgium; it always was, and remains tied to the
Queen of England's apron strings. Canada, we find, is always
first in carrying out Queen Elizabeth's wishes. Canadian troops
have fought in every one of Her Majesty's wars, including the
Boer War ( 1899- 1903).
   Like  its American  counterpart,  the  Canadian  Institute  of
International Affairs is a child of the Royal Institute for Interna-
tional Affairs (RIIA) and runs Canadian politics. Its members
have filled the position of Secretary of State ever since it was
founded in 1925. The Institute for Pacific Relations, the body
that fostered  the  attack on Pearl  Harbor,  was  welcomed  in
Canada after Owen Lattimore and his fellow members had their
treasonous activities exposed in 1947 and left the United States
before they could be charged.
    The Canadian Institute for International Affairs is connected
with the Rank Organization through Sir Kenneth Strong, who
was second in charge of MI6 at the end of the Second World
War. As a member of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, Strong
is the number two man in Canada for Rank and the British
Crown's commercial interests. He is on the board of one of the
most prolific drug banks in the world after the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Bank, the Bank of Nova Scotia, through which proceeds
of the Canadian heroin trade are handled.

                              190

   First in line is  Sir Brian Edward Mountain,  the ranking
member of the Knights of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. It
is well to remember that, when the British Crown wanted the
United  States  to  enter the  Second World War,  it  sent Lord
Beaverbrook and Sir Brian Mountain to meet with President
Roosevelt to deliver the Crown's orders in this regard. Roosevelt
complied by ordering the United States Navy to operate out of a
base in Greenland, from where attacks on German submarines
were carried out nine months before Pearl Harbor. This was
done without the knowledge and consent of the Congress.
   Another big name in the Rank-Canadian interfacing was Sir
Kenneth Keith, a director of Canada's equivalent of the Hong
Kong and Shanghai Bank, the Bank of Nova Scotia, dripping in
drug money laundering. He was also on the board of Britain's
oldest and most venerable newspaper institution, the London
Times and the Sunday Times. For over 100 years the "Times"
has been the Crown's voice on foreign affairs, finance matters
and political life in England.
   Like so many Committee of 300 members, Sir Kenneth
circulated between MI6 and the opium supply chain of command
in Hong Kong and China, ostensibly on business for the Cana-
dian Institute for International Affairs, of which he was a member
Furthermore, as a director of the Hill Samuel banking house, his
presence in China and Hong Kong could be explained without
any  problem.  One  of his  closest  associates  outside  of MI6
circles was Sir Philip de Zuleta, the Committee of 300's direct
controller of all British prime ministers, both Conservative and
Labor. Sir Kenneth Strong tied in all the spokes of the drug
wheel, including terrorism, production of opium, the gold mar-
kets, dirty money laundering and banking to its central core, the
British Crown.
   At the top of British Crown control of Canada was Walter
Gordon. A former member of the Queen's hands-on oversight
committee, also known as the Privy Council, Gordon sponsored
the Institute for Pacific Relations via the Canadian Institute of

                              191

International Affairs. As a former minister of finance, Gordon
was able to place Committee of 300 selected accountants and
lawyers  inside the three main chartered banks: the Bank of
Nova  Scotia,  the  Canadian Imperial Bank and the  Toronto
Dominion Bank.
   Through these three "Crown banks" a network of Commit-
tee of 300 agents responsible to Gordon oversaw the world's
second largest dirty drug money laundering operation, with a
direct open door to China. Before his death, Gordon controlled
James Endicott, Chester Ronning and Paul Linn, identified by
MI6 as Canada's top "China specialists." All three men worked
closely with Chou-En-lai, who once told Gamal Abdul Nasser
that he would do to Britain and the USA what they had done to
China, i.e., turn them into nations of heroin addicts. Chou-En-
lai made good on his promise, starting with American GI's in
Vietnam. Other close collaborators in the Canadian heroin drug
ring were John D. Gilmer and John Robert Nicholson, both
members of the Order of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem.
   Lord Hartley Shawcross, who is believed to report directly
to Queen Elizabeth II, was on the board of the Royal Institute
for International Affairs and chancellor of Sussex University
where the notorious Tavistock Institute for Human Relations is
located, with extensive connections in Canada.
   As part of Rank's United States operation, no other single
company has been more successful for Rank than the Corning
Group, owners of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
and the New York Life Insurance Company. Committee of 300
members, Amory Houghton and his brother James Houghton,
have long served the British Crown through the above named
insurance companies, and Corning Glass, Dow Corning and
Corning International. Both sit on the board of IBM and Citicorp.
James  Houghton  is  a director of the Princeton Institute for
Advanced Studies, a director of the J. Pierpont Morgan Library,
a stronghold of the RIIA and the CFR, and he is also a director
of CBS.

                              192

   It was the Houghton brother who donated hundreds of
acres known as Wye Plantation in Maryland to the British
Crown's Aspen Institute. Also on the Corning Glass board sits
the Bishop of the Archdiocese of the Anglican (Episcopalian)
Church of Boston. All this gives the group its much-vaunted air
of respectability,  which  insurance  company  executive s  must
carry, and as we shall see, in addition to James Houghton, Keith
Funston and John Harper, both on Corning's board, run the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
   The MASSIVE gridding and interfacing of just this one
single unit of the Committee of 300 will give us a good indica-
tion of the vast power at the disposal of the conspirators' hier-
archy, before which all knees are bowed, including the knee of
the President of the United States, whomever that happens to be.
   What is important to note is how this American company,
one of HUNDREDS, is interfaced with British intelligence,
with Canada, the Far East and South Africa, not to mention its
gridding of corporate officials and directors reaching into every
aspect of business and politics in the United States.
   While Metropolitan Life Insurance Company does not begin
to compare with the Committee of 300's giant Assicurazioni
Generale,  it  is  nevertheless  a  good  indicator of how the
Houghtons'power extends right across the business spectrum
of the U.S. and Canada. Starting with R. H. Macy, (whose floor
walkers no longer wear red carnations to honor the company's
affiliation with Communism), the Royal Bank of Canada, Na-
tional and Westminster Bank, Intertel (a virulent and vile private
intelligence agency), Canadian Pacific,  The Reader's Digest,
RCA, AT&T, the Harvard Business School, W. R. Grace Shipping
Company, Ralston Purina Company, U.S. Steel, Irving Trust,
Consolidated Edison of New York and ABC, the Houghtons'
power grid extends as far as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank.
   Another successful Rank company in the United States is
the Reliance Insurance Group. As an integral part of the Strate-
gic Bombing Survey, Reliance established the initial structural

                              193

base for brainwashing, opinion-making, polling, survey and the
systems analysis used by the Tavistock Institute in the United
States. The Reliance Insurance Company, based in Philadelphia,
set  up  the  corporate  structure  which  enabled  the  Strategic
Bombing Survey to be turned against the people of the United
States  who,  although unaware  of it, have been subjected to
savage psychological warfare for the past 45 years.
   A key operative in this assault on the United States was
David Bialkin of the Committee of 300 law firm, Wilkie, Farr
and Gallagher. Bialkin ran the Anti-Defamation League (ADL)
for many years. The ADL is a British intelligence operation
founded in the U.S. by MI6 and run by Saul Steinberg and Eric
Trist of Tavistock. Saul Steinberg is the U.S. representative and
business partner of the Jacob de Rothschild family of London.
   Reliance Corporation is home for Carl Lindner who suc-
ceeded Eli Black when he "fell" from a 44th floor window of a
New York skyscraper. Reliance Company interfaces with the
powerful United Fruit Company of Boston and New Orleans
run by Max Fisber who, before be was sheepdipped, was a well-
known Detroit underworld figure. United Fruit Company has
long been a conveyer of heroin and cocaine into the U.S. under
the expertise of Misbulam Riklis of Rapid American Corporation
who masterminds shipments from Canada to the U.S. Remem-
ber, all this is under the aegis of a single company, gridding and
interfacing with a myriad of smaller companies and operations
to give the Committee of 300 full control of a multiplicity of
operations, each one carefully interlocked in the grid.
   Reliance Group is a spinoff of the parent company whose
function  it  is  to  brainwash  the American people  through a
network of pollsters and opinion makers and relies on Opera-
tions  Research  for direct links with the Tavistock Institute.
Another associate company is Leasco, which is closely inter-
faced with AT&T, Disclosure Incorporated, Western Union In-
ternational, Imbucon Ltd and Yankelovich, Skelly and White.
   Daniel Yankelovich is the emperor of the polling-opinion

                              194

making corporate structure in the United States, a vast apparatus
which provides "public opinions on social, economic and political
matters of substance," to quote Edward Bernays. It was this vast
apparatus that turned the majority of Americans, who had never
even heard of Saddam Hussein and vaguely knew that Iraq was
a country somewhere in the Middle East, into a people howling
for his blood and the extermination of Iraq as a nation.
   Yankelovich utilized to the full all knowledge gained during
the Second World War. As  a  second-generation  warrior,
Yankelovich has no equal, which is why ABC polls conducted
by his company are always in the forefront of "public opinion."
The population of the United States was targeted in the same
manner of German worker housing by attacking the sense of
reality. This technique is, of course, standard training for certain
intelligence groups, which includes the CIA.
   Yankelovich's task was to destroy traditional American values
and replace them with New Age-Age of Aquarius values. As the
Committee of 300's most senior public opinion maker, no one
can doubt that Yankelovich has done a superb job.
   Probably the best way to explain what methods are used and
what results are expected to be achieved is to quote John Naisbitt's
work as explained in his "Trend Report." Naisbitt has acted as
advisor to Lyndon Johnson, Eastman Kodak, IBM, America
Express, the Center for Policy Study, Chase Manhattan, General
Motors, Louis Harris Polls, the White House, Institute of Life
Insurance, the American Red Cross, Mobil Oil, B.P. and a host of
Committee of 300 companies and institutions. His methodology,
derived from MI6 Tavistock procedures, is of course not unique:

   "I will briefly outline our methodology. In developing
   Trend Report for our clients we rely mostly on a system
   of monitoring local events and behavior. We are over-
   whelmingly impressed with the extent to which this is a
   bottom-up  society,  so  we  monitor  what  is  going  on
   locally, rather than what is going on in Washington or

                              195

   New York. Things start in Los Angeles, in Tampa, in
   Hartford, in Wichita, Portland, San Diego and Denver. It
   is a very much 'from the bottom-up' society.

   "The tracking concept employed in determining these
   trends has its roots in WW II. During the war, intelli-
   gence experts  sought to find a method for obtaining
   information on enemy nations that public opinion polls
   would normally have provided. Under the leadership of
   Paul Lazarsfeld and Harold Laswell, a method was de-
   veloped for monitoring  what was  going on  in these
   societies that involved doing a content analysis of the
   daily press.

   "Although this method of monitoring public thinking
   continues to be the choice of the intelligence commu-
   nity   the  nation  annually  spends  millions  of dollars
   doing  newspaper content analyses  in  all parts  of the
   world.... The reason this system of monitoring changes
   in society works so well is that 'news holes' in newspa-
   pers is a closed system. For economic reasons the amount
   of space devoted to news in a newspaper doesn't change
   over time.
 
   "So when something new is introduced into that news
   hole, something or a combination of things has to go out
   or be omitted. The principle involved here is classified
   as a forced choice within a closed system. In this forced
   situation societies add new preoccupations and forget
   old ones. We keep track of the ones that are added and
   the ones that are given up.

   "Evidently,  societies are like human beings.  I do not
   know what the number is, but a person can only keep so
   many problems and concerns in his head at any one

                              196

   time.  If new problems  or concerns  are  added,  some
   existing ones must be given up. We keep track of what
   Americans have given up and have taken up.

   "The United States is rapidly shifting from a mass indus-
   trial society to an information society and the final impact
   will be more profound than the 19th century shift from
   an agricultural to an industrial society. Starting in 1979,
   the number one occupation in the U.S. became clerking,
   replacing laborer and farmer. In this latter statement is a
   brief history of the United States."

   It is not by chance that Naisbitt is a member of the Club of
Rome and, as such, a "senior staffer" of the Committee of 300.
He is  also one of the senior vice presidents of Yankelovich,
Skelly  and White. What Naisbitt is  doing  is  not forecasting
trends but MAKING them. We have seen how the industrial
base of the United States has been destroyed, starting with the
steel industry. In 1982 I wrote a work I called "Death of the
Steel Industry," in which I stated that by the mid-1990's, steel
production in the U.S. will have declined to a point of no return,
and that the auto and housing industries would go the same way.
   All this has come to pass, and what we are witnessing today
is not an economic recession due not only to unsound economic
policies, but the deliberately planned destruction of our indus-
trial base--and along with it the destruction of America's unique
middle class--the backbone of the country--which depends on
a progressive industrial expansion for growth and for steady
employment.
   This is one of the reasons why the recession, which started
in earnest in January of 1991, has turned into a depression from
which the United States as we knew it in the 1960's-1970's will
most probably never reappear. The economy will not come out
of the depression of 1991 until at least 1995- 1996, at which time
the United States will have become an entirely different society

                              197

from the one it when the recession began.
   Opinion makers have played no small part in this war on the
United States; we need to examine the role of the Committee of
300 in bringing about these far-reaching changes and how the
social engineers have used central systems analyses to keep
public opinion from expressing anything other than the policies
of the invisible government. How and where did it all begin?
   From documents covering the First World War that I was
able to gather and examine in the War Office in Whitehall,
London,  it appears that the Royal  Institute for International
Affairs was commissioned by the Committee of 300 to do a
study of manipulating war information. This task was given to
Lord Northcliffe and Lord Rothmere and Arnold Toynbee, who
was MI6's agent at the RIIA. Lord Rothmere's family owned a
newspaper which was used to support various government po-
sitions, so it was thought that the paper could change public
perceptions, especially among the ranks of growing opposition
to the war.
   The project was housed in Wellington House, named after
the Duke of Wellesly. American specialists drafted to help Lords
Rothmere and Northcliffe included Edward Bernays and Walter
Lippman. The group held "brain storming" sessions to work out
techniques for mobilizing mass support for the war, especially
among the working class people whose sons were expected to
go to the slaughter fields of Flanders in record numbers.
   Using Lord Rothmere's newspaper, new manipulative tech-
niques were tried out and, after a period of about 6 months, it was
apparent that they were a success. What the researchers discov-
ered was that only a very small group of people understood the
process of reasoning and the ability to observe the problem as
opposed to passing an opinion on it. This, said Lord Rothmere,
was the way in which 87% of the British public approached the
war, and that the same principle applied not only to the war, but
to every conceivable problem in society in general.
   In this manner, irrationality was elevated to a high level of

                              198

public consciousness. The manipulators then played upon this
to undermine and distract the grasp of reality governing any
given situation and, the more complex the problems of a modern
industrial society became, the easier it became to bring greater
and greater distractions to bear so that what we ended up with
was that the absolutely inconsequential opinions of masses of
people, created by skilled manipulators, assumed the position of
scientific fact.
   Having literally stumbled upon so profound a conclusion,
the manipulators put it to one test after another during the war,
so that in spite of hundreds of thousands of the youth of Britain
being slaughtered on the battlefields of France, there was virtually
no opposition to the bloody war. Records of the time show that
by 1917, just before the United States entered the war, 94% of
the British working class bearing the brunt of the war did not
have the faintest idea what they were fighting for, other than the
image created by the media manipulators that the Germans were
a horrible race, bent upon destroying their monarch and their
country, and who had to be wiped off the face of the earth.
   Certainly nothing has changed because, in 1991, we had the
exact same situation created by the news media which allowed
President Bush to flagrantly violate the Constitution in waging a
war of genocide against the nation of Iraq with the full consent
of 87% of the American people. Woodrow Wilson can be cred-
ited--if that is the proper expression to use--of jumping on the
public opinion manipulators' band wagon and using it to further
the causes whispered in his ear by his controller, Colonel House.
   On instructions from President Wilson, or rather Colonel
House, the Creel Commission was created and, as far as can bb
ascertained, the Creel Commission was the first organization in
the United States to use the RIIA techniques and methodology
for polling and mass propaganda. The psychological warfare
experiments perfected at Wellington House were used in the
Second World War with equal success, and have been in continuous
use in the massive psychological war against the United States

                              199

which began in 1946. The methods did not change, only the
target. Now it was not German worker housing but the middle
class of the United States that became the focus of the attack.
   As so often happens, the conspirators could not contain their
glee. After WW II, in 1922 to be precise, Lippmann detailed the
work done by the RIIA in a book he called  "PUBLIC OPINION":

   "Public opinion deals with indirect, unseen and puzzling
   facts,  and  there  is  nothing  obvious  about them.  The
   situations to which public opinion refers are known only
   as  opinions,  pictures  inside  heads  of human  beings,
   pictures of themselves, of others, of their needs, purposes
   and relationships, are their public opinions. These pictures
   which are acted upon by groups of people, or by indi-
   viduals  acting  in the name  of groups  are PUBLIC
   OPINION  with  capital  letters.  The picture  inside  the
   head often misleads men in their dealings with the world
   outside of their heads."

   No wonder Lippmann was chosen to make the people of the
United States "like" the Beatles when they arrived on our shores
and were thrust upon an unsuspecting country. Combined with
the propaganda sent forth night and day from radio and television
it was only a comparatively short time before The Beatles
became  "popular." The technique of radio  stations  allegedly
receiving  hundreds  of requests  from imaging  listeners  for
Beatlemusic, led to charts and ratings for first, the "top ten" and
gradually escalated until, by 1992, it has expanded to "the top
40 on the charts."
   In 1928, Lippmann's compatriot Edward Bernays wrote a
book called "CRYSTALLIZING PUBLIC OPINION" and in
1928  a  second book of his  was published entitled  simply
"PROPAGANDA." In it Bernays described his experiences at
Wellington House. Bernays was a close friend of Master Ma-
nipulator H.G. Wells, whose many quasi-novels were used by

                              200

Bernays to help formulate mass mind control techniques.
   Wells was not shy about his role as a leader in changing
lower class society, mainly because he was a close friend of
members of the British royal family, and spent a great deal of
time with some of the most highly placed politicians of the day,
men like Sir Edward Grey, Lord Haldane, Robert Cecil of the
Jewish Cecil family that had controlled the British monarchy
since a Cecil became the private secretary and lover of Queen
Elizabeth I, Leo Amery, Halford Mackinder of MI6 and later
head of the London School of Economics, whose pupil Bruce
Lockhart would become MI6 controller of Lenin and Trotsky
during the Bolshevik Revolution, and even the great man himself,
Lord Alfred Milner.
   One of Well's favorite watering holes was the prestigious St.
Ermins Hotel, meeting place of the Coefficient Club, a club to
which certified gentlemen only were admitted and where they
met once a month. All of the men mentioned above were mem-
bers and also members of the Souls Club. Wells claimed that
any nation could be defeated, not by direct confrontation but by
understanding the human mind--what he called, "the mental
hinterlands hidden behind the persona."
   With such a powerful backer, Bernays felt confident enough
to launch his "PROPAGANDA":

   "As civilization becomes more complex, AND AS THE
   NEED FOR INVISIBLE GOVERNMENT HAS
   BEEN INCREASINGLY DEMONSTRATED (em-
   phasis added-JC), the technical means have been invented
   and developed BY WHICH PUBLIC OPINION MAY
   BE REGIMENTED (emphasis added-JC). With print-
   ing press and newspaper, the telephone, telegraph, radio
   and airplanes,  ideas  can be  spread rapidly,  and even
   instantaneously, across the whole of America." Bernays
   had not yet seen how much better television, which was
   to follow, would do the job.

Copyright (C) 1992 by Dr. John Coleman

Conspirators' Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of 300", by
Dr. John Coleman, is reproduced here with the permission of the
publisher: America West Publishers.

                INSTITUTIONS THROUGH WHICH
                
                   CONTROL IS EXERCISED
                         (Cont.)

    "The  conscious  and  intelligent manipulation of orga-
    nized habits and opinions of the masses is an impor-
    tant element in a democratic society. Those who ma-
    nipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an
    INVISIBLE GOVERNMENT WHICH IS THE
    TRUE RULING POWER IN OUR COUNTRY." To
    back up his position, Bernays quoted H. G. Wells' article
    published in the New York Times in which Wells enthu-
    siastically backed the idea of modern means of commu-
    nication "opening up a new world of political processes
    which will allow the common design to be documented
    and sustained against perversion and betrayal" (of the
    invisible government).

    To  continue  with  the  revelations  contained in
"PROPAGANDA":

    "We are governed, our minds are moulded, our tastes
    formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have
    never heard of. What ever attitude one chooses to take
    toward this condition, it remains a fact that in almost
    every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of
    politics or business, our social conduct or our ethical
    thinking, we are dominated by a relatively small number
    of persons, a trifling fraction of our hundred and twenty
    million, who understand the mental processes and social
    patterns of the masses.  It is they who pull the wires
    which control the public mind,  and who harness  old
    social forces and contrive new ways TO BIND AND
    GUIDE THE WORLD" (emphasis added-JC).

   Bernays was not bold enough to tell the world who the
"THEY"  are  who  "pull  the  wires  which  control  the  public
mind...," but in this book we shall make up for his intentional
oversight by disclosing the existence of that "relatively small

                              202

number of persons," the Committee of 300. Bernays was roundly
applauded for his work by the CFR whose members voted to
place him in charge of CBS. William Paley became his "under-
graduate" and eventually replaced Bernays, having acquired
thorough knowledge of the new-science science of public opin-
ion making, which made CBS the leader of the field, a role
which CBS television and radio has never relinquished.
   Political and financial control by the "relatively small num-
ber," as Bernays called them, is exercised through a number of
secret societies, most notably the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry,
and perhaps even more importantly, through the Venerable Or-
der of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, an ancient order
consisting  of the  British  monarch's  hand-picked  executives
chosen for their expertise in areas vital to the continued control
of the Committee.
   In my work "The Order of St. John of Jerusalem" published
in 1986, I described The Order in the following manner:

    "...It is therefore not a secret society, except where its
   purposes have been perverted in the inner councils like
   the Order of the Garter, which is a prostituted oligarchi-
   cal creation of the British royal family, which makes a
   mockery of what the Sovereign Order of St. John of
   Jerusalem stands for.

   "As  an  example,  we  find  the  atheist  Lord Peter
   Carrington, who pretends to be an Anglican Christian
   but who is a member of the Order of Osiris and other
   demonic sects, including Freemasonry, installed as  a
   Knight of the Garter at St. George's Chapel, Windsor
   Castle, by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II of England,
   of the Black Nobility Guelphs, also head of the Anglican
   Church, which she thoroughly despises."

    Carrington was selected by the Committee of 300 to bring

                              203

down the government of Rhodesia, sign over the mineral wealth
of Angola and South West Africa to City of London control,
wreck the Argentine and turn NATO into a leftwing political
organization beholden to the Committee of 300.
    Another  strange face  we see attaching itself to the  Holy
Christian Order of St. John of Jerusalem, and I use the word
stranger as it is used in the original Hebrew of the Old Testa-
ment to denote the lineage of an individual, is that of Major
Louis Mortimer Bloomfield, the man who helped plan the mur-
der of John F. Kennedy. We see photos of this "strange" man
wearing with pride the Cross of Malta, the same cross worn on
the sleeve of the Knights of the Order of the Garter.
   We have been so brainwashed that we believe the British
royal family is just a nice, harmless and colorful institution, and
fail to realize just how corrupt and therefore highly dangerous is
this institution called the British Monarchy. The Knights of the
Order of the Garter are the INNERMOST circle of the most
corrupt public  servants  who  have  utterly betrayed  the  trust
placed in them by their nation, their people.
    The Knights of the Order of the Garter are the leaders of the
Committee of 300, Queen Elizabeth II's most trusted "privy
council." When I did my research on the Order of St. John of
Jerusalem some years ago, I went to Oxford to talk with one of
the Masters who is a specialist on ancient and modern British
traditions. He told me that the Knights of the Garter are the inner
sanctum, the elite of the elite of Her Majesty's Most Venerable
Order of St.  John of Jerusalem.  Let me say  this  is  not the
original order founded by the true Christian warrior, Peter Gerard,
but is typical of many fine institutions that are taken over and
destroyed from the inside, while yet appearing to the uninitiated
to be the original.
   From Oxford I went to the Victoria and Albert Museum and
gained  access  to the papers  of Lord Palmerston,  one of the
founders of the Opium Dynasty in China. Palmerston, like so
many of his kind, was not only a Freemason, but a dedicated

                              204

servant  of  Gnosticism....  Like  the  present  'royal  family,'
Palmerston made a pretense of being a Christian but was in fact
a servant of Satan. Many satanists became leaders of British aris-
tocracy and made immense fortunes out of the China opium trade.
   I learned from the papers in the museum named after Victoria
that she changed the name of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem
in 1885 in order to break away from the Catholic connection of
the Order's founder, Peter Gerard, and renamed it the "Protestant
Most Venerable Order of Jerusalem." Membership was open to
every oligarchical family that had made its fortune in the China
opium trade and every thoroughly decadent family received
place in the 'new order.'
   Many of these venerable gentlemen were responsible for
overseeing the prohibition era in the United States from Canada,
where several of its members supplied the whisky ferried to the
United States. Notable among this group was Committee of 300
member Earl Haig, who gave his whisky franchise to old Joe
Kennedy.  Both prohibition  and  the  distilleries who met the
demand for alcohol were creations of the British Crown acting
through the Committeemen of 300. It was an experiment which
became the forerunner of today's drug trade, and the lessons
learned from the prohibition era are being applied to the soon to
be legalized drug trade.
   Canada is the route most used by Far East heroin suppliers.
The British Monarchy  sees to it that this information never
becomes public. Using her powers, Queen Elizabeth rules over
Canada through the Governor-General (one wonders how modern
Canadians can accept such an archaic arrangement?), who is the
Queen's PERSONAL representative, and on down the line to
the Privy Council (yet another archaic hang-over from colonialist
days) and the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who control
Canadian commerce in all of its facets.
    Opposition to British rule is suppressed. Canada has some
of the most restrictive laws in the world, including so-called
"hate crime" laws imposed upon the country by Jewish men-

                              205

bers of the House of Lords in England. At present there are four
major trials in various stages in Canada involving persons charged
with "hate crimes." These are the Finta, Keegstra, Zundel and
Ross cases. Anyone who dares to try and show proof of Jewish
control of Canada (which the Bronfmans exercise), is immedi-
ately arrested and charged with so-called "hate crimes." This
will  give  us  some  idea of the vastness  of the  reach  of the
Committee of 300 which quite literally sits on top of everything
n this world.
   Testifying to the truth of this statement is the fact that the
Committee of 300 set up the International Institute for Strategic
Studies  (IISS)  under the auspices of the Round Table.  This
institute is the vehicle for M16-Tavistock black propaganda and
wet jobs  (an intelligence cover name denoting  an operation
where bloodshed is required), nuclear and terrorist, which goes
to the world's press for dissemination, as well as to government
and military establishments.
   Membership of IISS includes representatives of 87 major
wire services and press associations as well as 138 senior editors
and columnists drawn from international newspapers and maga-
zines. Now you know where your favorite columnist gets all of
his information and opinions from. Remember Jack Anderson,
Tom Wicker, Sam Donaldson, John Chancellor, Mary McGrory,
Seymour Hersh, Flora Lewis and Anthony Lewis, et al? The
information provided by IISS, especially scenarios like those
prepared to blacken President Hussein and to justify the coming
attack on Libya and condemn the PLO are all specially tailor-
made for the occasion. The Mai Lai massacre story published by
Seymour Hersh came straight out of IISS, just in case we wrongly
suppose that men like Hersh do their own research work.
    The International Institute for Strategic Studies is nothing
more  than  a  higher  echelon  opinion-maker  as  defined  by
Lippmann and Bernays. Instead of writing books, newspapers
report opinions presented by chosen columnists, and IISS was
formed to be a coordinating center for not only creating opin-

                              206

ions, but to get those opinions and scenarios out much faster and
to a greater audience than could be reached by  a book, for
example. IISS is a good example of the gridding and interfacing
of Committee of 300 institutions.
   The idea of bringing IISS  into being  arose  at the  1957
Bilderberger meeting. It will be recalled that the Bilderberger
Conference is a creation of M16 under the direction of the Royal
Institute of International Affairs. The idea came from Alastair
Buchan, son of Lord Tweedsmuir. Buchan was chairman at the
time, and a board member of the RIIA and a member of the
Round Table reportedly very close to the British royal family
This was the same conference that welcomed Labour Party
leader Dennis Healey to its ranks. Others in attendance were
Francois Duchene, whose mentor, Jean Monet Duchenes, ran
the Trilateral Commission under the tutelage of H. V.  Dicks
from Tavistock's Columbus Center.
   Among the governing council of this gigantic propaganda
opinion-making apparat is included the following:
       Frank  Kitson,  a  one  time  controller  of The  IRA
          PROVISIONALS, the man who started the Mau-
          Mau insurgency in Kenya.
       Lazard Freres, represented by Robert Ellsworth.
       N. M. Rothschild, represented by John Loudon.
       Paul Nitze, representative of Schroeder Bank. Nitze has
          played a very prominent and substantial role in mat-
          ters of Arms Control agreements, which have AL-
          WAYS been under the direction of the RIIA.
       C. L. Sulzberger of the New York Times.
       Stansfield Turner, a former director of the CIA.
       Peter Calvocoressi, representing Penguin Books.
       Royal Institute for International Affairs, represented by
          Andrew Schoenberg.
       Columnists and Reporters, represented by Flora Lewis,
          Drew Middleton, Anthony Lewis, Max Frankel.
       Daniel Ellsberg.

                              207

      Henry Kissinger.
      Robert Bowie, a former director of the ClA's National
          Intelligence Estimates.
   Flowing from the 1957 Bilderberger meeting, Kissinger was
instructed to open a Round Table office in Manhattan, the nucleus
of which consisted of Haig, Ellsberg, Halperin, Schlessinger,
McNamara and the McBundy brothers. Kissinger was directed to
fill  all  executive  positions  in  the  Nixon  administration  with
Round Tablers, loyal to the RIIA and therefore to the Queen of
England.  It  was  no  accident that  Kissinger  chose  President
Nixon's old hangout, the Hotel Pierre, as his center of operations.
   The significance of the Round Table-Kissinger operation
was thus: On orders of the RIIA chairman Andrew Schoeberg, a
block was placed on all agencies involved in intelligence, pre-
venting them from giving information to President Nixon. This
meant  Kissinger and  his  staff were  getting ALL INTELLI-
GENCE, FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC, LAW ENFORCE-
MENT INFORMATION, INCLUDING FBI DIVISION 5, be-
fore any of it was released to the President. This made certain
that all M16-controlled terrorist operations in the U.S.  would
have no chance of being leaked. This was Halperin's bailiwick.
   By working this methodology, Kissinger at once established
hegemony  over the Nixon presidency,  and after Nixon  was
disgraced by the Kissinger group and hounded from office,
Kissinger emerged with unprecedented powers such as have not
been equaled before or since Watergate. Some of these seldom
enumerated powers included the following:
   Kissinger ordered National Security Decision Memorandum
No. I to be drafted by Halperin, who got the actual wording
directly  from  the  RIIA through  Round Table  circles.  The
memorandum appointed Kissinger as the supreme U.S. author-
ity, chairman of the Verification Panel. All SALT negotiations
were directed from here, using Paul Nitze, Paul Warnke and a
nest of traitors inside the Arms Control mission at Geneva.
   In addition, Kissinger was appointed to The Vietnam Special

                              208

Studies  Group,  which oversaw  and made evaluations  of all
reports,  civilian and military, including intelligence reports
coming out of Vietnam. Kissinger also demanded and got over-
sight of the "40 Committee," a super-secret agency that has the
task of deciding when and where to initiate covert activities and
then monitors the progress of operations it sets in motion.
    Meantime Kissinger ordered a blizzard of wire-taps by the
FBI, even on his closest assistants, so as to give the impression
that he was on top of everything. Most of his circle were told
that wiretaps on them were in force. This nearly backfired was
an M16 operative by the name of Henry Brandon was ordered
wiretapped, but was not informed by Kissinger. Brandon was
doubling as a reporter for the London Times and Kissinger very
nearly got thrown out because nobody does this to the London Times.
   The full story of the Ellsberg break-in and the subsequent
Watergating of Nixon is too long to be included here. Suffice to
say, Kissinger had control of Ellsberg from the day that Ellsberg
was recruited while at Cambridge. Ellsberg had always been a
hardliner in favor of the Vietnam War, but was gradually "con-
verted" to a radical leftist activist. His "conversion" was only a
shade less miraculous than St. Paul's Damascus Road experience.
   The entire spectrum of the new left in the United States was
the work of British intelligence M16 acting through Round
Table assets and the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS). Just as it
did with all countries with a republican base, whose policies had
to be changed, LPS played a leading role, even as it does today in
South Africa and South Korea. Much of IPS's activities are
explained in my work "IPS Revisited" published in 1990.
   IPS had one main function, that being to sow discord and
spread disinformation resulting in chaos. One such program,
aimed at America's youth, centered on drugs. Through a series
of IPS fronts, acts like the stoning of Nixon's motorcade and a
large number of bombings, a climate of deception was effec-
tively created which led a majority of Americans to believe that
the United States was under threat from the KGB, the GRU and

                              209

Cuban DGI. The word went out that a lot of these imaginary
agents  had  close  ties  to  the  Democrats  through  George
McGovern. It was in fact, a model disinformation campaign for
which M16 is justly famous.
   Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Nixon's closest aides had no
clue as to what was happening, hence a flurry of statements
emanating from the White House that East Germany, The Soviet
Union, North Korea and Cuba were training terrorists and funding
their operations in the United States. I doubt whether Nixon
knew very much about IPS, let alone suspected what it was
doing  to  his  presidency.  We  suffered  the  same  kind  of
disinformation during the Gulf War when the word went out that
terrorists of all stripes were about to invade the United States
and blow up everything in sight.
   President Nixon was literally left in the dark. He didn't even
know that David Young, a Kissinger pupil, was working in the
basement of the White House, supervising "leaks." Young was a
graduate of Oxford and a long-time Kissinger associate through
Round Table assets such as the law firm of Milbank Tweed.
President Nixon was no match for the forces arrayed against
him under the direction of M16 on behalf of the Royal Institute
for International Affairs and hence the British royal family.
    About the only thing that Nixon was guilty of, in so far as
Watergate is concerned, was his ignorance of what was going on
all around him. When James McCord "confessed" to Judge John
Sirica, Nixon should have been on to it like a flash that McCord
was  playing  a  double  game.  He  ought to  have  challenged
Kissinger about his relationship with McCord there and then.
That would have thrown a spanner in the works and derailed the
whole M16-Watergate operation.
   Nixon did not abuse his presidential powers. His crime was
not defending the Constitution of the United States of America
and not charging Mrs. Katherine Meyer Graham and Ben Brad-
ley  with  conspiracy  to  commit insurrection.  Mrs.  Katherine
Meyer Graham's  pedigree  is  of the most doubtful  kind, as

                              210

"Jessica Fletcher" of "Murder She Wrote"  would soon have
discovered. But even knowing that, Mrs. Graham's controllers
in the Round Table would have fought hard to keep the lid on
things. The role of the Washington Post was to keep the pot
boiling by one "revelation" after another, thereby engendering a
climate of public distrust of President Nixon, even when there
was not one shred of evidence to support wrong doing by him.
   Yet it shows the immense power of the press, as Lippman
and Bernays had quite properly anticipated, in that Mrs. Graham,
long suspected of the murder of her husband, Philip L. Gra-
ham--officially classed as "suicide"--should have retained any
credibility at all. Other traitors who should have been indicted
for insurrection and treason were Kissinger, Haig,  Halperin,
Ellsberg, Young, McCord, Joseph Califano and Chomsky of IPS
and those CIA operatives who went to McCord's house and
burned  all  of his  papers.  Again, it is worth repeating that
Watergate, like many other operations we do not have the space
to include here, demonstrated the COMPLETE CONTROL
exercised over the United States by the Committee of 300.
   While Nixon kept company with people like Earl Warren
and some Mafia dons who had built Warren's house, that does
not mean that he should have been disgraced over the Watergate
Affair. My dislike of Nixon stems from his willingness to sign
the infamous ABM Treaty in 1972 and his all-too-cozy relation-
ship with Leonid Brezhnev. One of the sorriest slip-ups of the
Minority Council was its abject failure to expose the dirty role
played by INTERTEL, the Corning Group's ugly private intel-
ligence agency whom we have already met, who "leaked" a lot
of Watergate material to Edward Kennedy. Private intelligence
agencies like INTERTEL have no right to exist in the United
States. They are a MENACE to our right to privacy and an insult
to all free men everywhere.
   Blame must also fall on those who were supposed to protect
President Nixon from the kind of steelmesh net that was thrown
around him to isolate him. The intelligence personnel around

                              211

Nixon were a poor lot who had no knowledge of just how
thorough British intelligence operations are; indeed, they had no
inkling that Watergate was a British intelligence operation in its
entirety. The Watergate plot was a coup-d'etat against the United
States  of America,  as was the murder of John F. Kennedy.
Although this fact is not recognized as such today, I am confi-
dent that when all the secret papers are finally opened, history
will record that two coup-d'etats, one against Kennedy and one
against Nixon, did indeed take place, and which in their wake
brought the most violent rape and assault on the institutions
upon which the Republic of the United States stands.
   The individual who most deserves the title of traitor and
who is most guilty of sedition is General Alexander Haig. This
desk-man office-colonel whose paper-shuffling career did not
include commanding any troops in battle, was suddenly thrust
upon the scene by the invisible upper-level parallel government
President Nixon once described him as a man who had to ask
Kissinger's permission to go to the bathroom.
   Haig was a product of the Round Table. He was noticed by
Round Tabler Joseph Califano, one of Her Majesty's most trusted
Round  Tablers  in  the  United  States.  Joseph  Califano,  legal
council of the Democratic National Convention, had actually
interviewed Alfred Baldwin, one of the plumbers A MONTH
BEFORE THE BURGLARY TOOK PLACE. Califano was stu-
pid enough to write a memorandum on his interview with Baldwin,
in which he gave details of information on McCord's background
and why McCord had selected Baldwin to be on the "team."
   Even more damaging, Califano's memorandum contained
full details of transcripts of wiretaps of conversations between
Nixon and the reelection committee, all this BEFORE the break-
in occurred. Califano should have been indicted on a score of
federal offenses; instead he got away cleanly with his criminal
activity.  Sanctimonious  Sam Ervin refused to  allow Fred
Thompson, Minority Council, to introduce this highly damag-
ing evidence at the Watergate hearings--on the spurious grounds

                              212

that it was "too speculative."
   On Round Table orders, Kissinger had Haig promoted from
colonel to four-star general in the most meteoric rise ever re-
corded in the annals of United States military history, in the
course of which Haig was leap-frogged over 280 senior U.S.
Army generals and high-ranking officers.
    During Haig's "promotion," and as a result of it, 25 senior
generals were forced to resign. As a reward for his treachery
toward President Nixon, AND THE UNITED STATES, Haig
was subsequently given the plum job of Commanding General
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces (NATO), al-
though he was THE LEAST QUALIFIED COMMANDER
EVER TO HOLD THAT POSITION. Here again he was leap-
frogged over 400 senior generals from NATO countries and the
United States.
   When the news of his appointment reached the Soviet Armed
Forces High Command, Marshall Orgakov recalled his three top
Warsaw Pact generals from Poland and East Germany, and there
was much merrymaking, clinking of glasses and quaffing of
champagne until well into the night. All through Haig's tenure
as commander of NATO forces the professional elite cadre of
the Soviet Armed Forces, men who have never been anything
else but professional soldiers, held Haig in the utmost contempt
and openly referred to him as the  "office manager of NATO."
They knew that Haig owed his appointment to the RIIA and not
to the United States military.
   But before his military promotion took him out of Washing-
ton, let it be known that Alexander Haig, in conjunction with
Kissinger, all but destroyed the office of the President of the
United States and its government. The chaos left by Kissinger
and Haig in the wake of Watergate has never been chronicled to
the best of my knowledge. On the insistence of the RIIA, Haig
virtually took over the management of the Government of the
United States after the April  1973 coup d'etat. Bringing 100
Round  Table  agents  chosen  from the  Brookings  Institution,

                              213

Institute Policy Studies and the Council on Foreign Rela-
tions, Haig filled the top one hundred posts in Washington with
men who, like himself, were beholden to a foreign power. In the
ensuing debacle, the Nixon Administration was torn asunder
and the United States along with it.
   Thrusting aside the pious platitudes and posturings of de-
fending the Constitution, Senator Sam Ervin did more to change
the United States than anything President Nixon was alleged to
have done, and the United States has not yet recovered from the
near-mortal wound of Watergate, a Committee of 300 sponsored
operation  conducted by the Royal Institute for International
Affairs, the Round Table and "hands on" M16 officers based in
the United States.
   The way President Nixon was first isolated, surrounded by
traitors and then confused, followed to the letter the Tavistock
method of gaining full control of a person according to the
methodology laid down by Tavistock's chief theoretician, Dr.
Kurt Lewin. I have already given details of Lewin's methodol-
ogy elsewhere in this book, but in view of the text-book case of
President Richard M.Nixon, I think it is worth repeating:

   "One of the main techniques for breaking morale through
    a strategy of terror consists in exactly this tactic--keep
    the person hazy as to where he stands and just what he
    may expect. In addition, if frequent vacillations between
    severe  disciplinary  measures  and  promises  of  good
    treatment together with the spreading of contradictory
    news, make the cognitive structure of this situation utterly
    unclear, then the individual may cease even to know a
    particular plan would lead toward or away from his goal.
    Under these conditions even those individuals who have
    definite goals and are ready to take risks are paralyzed
    by severe inner conflict in regard to what to do."

   Kissinger and Haig followed Tavistock training manuals to

                              214

the letter. The result was a distraught, confused, frightened and
demoralized President Nixon, whose only course of action--he
was told by Haig--was to resign. In 1983 I wrote two works, "The
Tavistock Institute: Sinister and Deadly" and "The Tavistock
Institute: Britain's Control of U.S. Policy," based upon Tavistock
secret manuals  which had fallen  into my  hands.  Tavistock
Institute's methods and actions are spelled out in these two works.
   So successfully were Tavistock methods applied to unseat
President Nixon that the people of this nation fully believed the
calumny of lies, distortions and set-piece contrived situations
mounted by the conspirator as truth, when in fact Watergate was
a diabolical lie from end to end. It is important to stress this because
we have certainly not seen the last of Watergate-type operations.
   What were the alleged impeachable offenses committed by
President Nixon,  and the  so-called "smoking  gun"  evidence
which was supposed to back up the charges? First, the "smoking
gun." This piece of FICTION was created by Kissinger and
Haig around the June 23rd tape, which Haig coerced Nixon into
surrendering to Leon Jaworski.
   Haig spent hours convincing President Nixon that this tape
would sink him, because it proved "beyond any doubt" that
Nixon was guilty of serious wrong doing and a co-conspirator in
the Watergate break-in. President Nixon's first response was to
tell Haig, "It's utter nonsense to make such a big deal of this,"
but Haig chipped away until Nixon became convinced that he
could not make a successful defense before the Senate, based
solely on this particular June 23rd tape!
   How had Haig accomplished his mission? Acting out a
scenario prepared for him by his Round Table controllers, Haig
had an unedited transcript of the "smoking gun" tape typed by
his staff. In reality there was nothing in the tape that President
Nixon could not have explained. Sensing this, Haig then circu-
lated his unauthorized unedited transcript of the tape among
Nixon's staunchest supporters in the House and Senate and the
Republican Party high command. Peppered with "smoking gun"

                              215

and "devastating," and coming from Nixon's trusted aide, the
transcript had the effect of a falcon hitting a flock of pigeons;
Nixon's supporters panicked and ran for cover.
   Following up his sedition and insurrection, Haig summoned
to his office Congressman Charles Wiggins, a staunch Nixon
supporter who had agreed to lead the fight in the House to head
off impeachment proceedings. In a bare-faced blatant lie, Wiggins
was informed by Haig, "The fight is lost." After that Wiggins
lost all interest in defending Nixon, believing that Nixon himself
had agreed to give up. Haig then dealt with Senator Griffin, a
leading supporter of the president in the Senate in the same way.
AS A RESULT OF HAIG'S SEDITIOUS, TREASONOUS
ACTIVITIES, SENATOR GRIFFIN IMMEDIATELY WROTE
A LETTER TO PRESIDENT NIXON CALLING UPON HIM
TO RESIGN.
  THREE MONTHS EARLIER, Round Table controlled In-
stitute for Policy Studies, child of James Warburg, founder and a
fellow, Marcus Raskin, delivered EXACTLY the same ultima-
tum that President Nixon resign, using the British intelligence
propaganda journal, The New York Times of May 25th to deliver
the ultimatum. The Watergate tragedy was a step in the irre-
versible transition to barbarism which is enveloping the United
States, and which is leading us into the One World Government-
New World Order. The United States is now at the same place
that Italy found itself when Aldo Moro tried to rescue it from
created instability.
   With what wrongdoing was Nixon charged? John Doar,
whose brutish character was well-suited to his task of bringing
so-called articles of impeachment against the president, was the
author and finisher of one of the most far-reaching ILLEGAL
domestic surveillance counterintelligence operations ever run in
the United States.
   Heading the Interdepartmental Intelligence Unit (IDIU), Doar
garnered  information from every conceivable  agency  of the
federal government,  including the Internal Revenue  Service.

                              216

The program was linked to the Institute for Policy Studies. One
of the highlights of John Doar's career was to provide the
CIA--which is forbidden by law to engage in domestic surveil-
lance, with 10,000-12,000 names of citizens he suspected as
political dissidents, for further investigation.
   On July  18th,  1974, this great upholder of the law, with
measured pomposity, delivered the "charges" against President
Nixon, which episode was nationally televised. THERE WAS
NOT A SINGLE PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT NIXON HAD
DONE ANYTHING IMPEACHABLE; indeed, Doar's pathetic
litany of Nixon's alleged "crimes" were so trivial that it is a
wonder the proceedings went beyond this point. Income tax
fiddling, unauthorized bombing of Cambodia and a vague "abuse
of power" charge that would never have stuck in a court of law
was the best that Doar could do. The United States  was as
unstable as it would ever be when President Nixon resigned on
August 8th, 1974.
   Nowhere more so than in our economic and fiscal policies.
In 1983 the international bankers met in Williamsburg, Virginia
to work out a strategy to prepare the United States for a total
disintegration of its banking system. This planned event was to
stampede the U.S. Senate into accepting control of our mon-
etary and fiscal policies by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).  Dennis  Weatherstone  of Morgan  Guarantee  on Wall
Street stated that he was convinced this was the only way for the
United States to save itself.
   The proposal was endorsed by the Ditchley Group which
had its beginning in May of 1982 at Ditchley Park in London.
On January lOth-11th, l983, this alien group met in Washington
D.C., in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Clayton
Act, and conspired to overthrow the sovereignty of the United
States of America in its monetary and financial freedom. The
United States Attorney General knew of the meeting and its
purpose. Instead of charging members of the group with con-
spiracy to commit a federal crime, he simply looked the other way.

                              217

    Under the abovementioned acts, proof of a conspiracy is all
that is  needed for a felony conviction,  and there  was  ample
evidence that a conspiracy did indeed take place.  But as the
Ditchley Foundation had met at the request of the Royal Insti-
tute  for  International Affairs  and  was  hosted by  the  Round
Table, no one in the Justice Department had the courage to take
action as required by those who had sworn to uphold the laws of
the United States.
   The Ditchley Plan to usurp control of the fiscal and mon-
etary policies of the United States was the brainchild of Sir
Harold Lever, a strong backer of Zionism and a close confidant
of members of the British royal family and a member of the
Committee of 300. Sir Harold Lever was a director of the giant
UMILEVER conglomerate,  an important Committee of 300
company.  Lever's plan called for the IMF's influence to be
broadened so that it could influence central banks of all nations,
including the U.S. and guide them into the hands of a One World
Government bank.
   This was considered a vital step in bringing about a situation
where the IMF would become the supreme arbiter of world
banking. The ultra-secret January meeting was preceded by an
earlier meeting in October 1982, and was attended by represen-
tatives of 36 of the world's top banks who met at the New York
Vista Hotel. Security for the October 26th-27th seminar was as
tight as anything ever seen in the Big Apple. This earlier Ditchley
Group meeting also violated United States law.
   Addressing the meeting, Sir Harold Lever said it was essential
that national sovereignty as an archaic hang-over must be ended
before  the year 2000.  "The United States  will  soon  have to
realize that it will be no better than any Third World country
when the IMF takes control,"  said Sir Harold.  It was  later
reported to the delegates that plans to appoint the IMF as the
controller of United States fiscal policies were being readied to
bring before the United States Senate by the year 2000.
   Rimmer de Vries, speaking for Morgan Guarantee, said it

                              218

was high time that the United States became a member of the
Bank of International Settlements. "There must be a reconsid-
eration of U.S. hesitancy over the past 50 years," De Vries
declared. Some British and German bankers, fearing possible
violations of U.S. law, said that the Ditchley Group is nothing
but  a committee  to  iron  out exchange rate problems.  Felix
Rohatyn also spoke of the great need to change U.S. banking
laws so that the IMF could play a greater role in this country.
Rohatyn headed Lazard Freres, a Club of Rome bank and part of
the Eagle Star Group which we have already met.
   Round Tablers William Ogden and Werner Stang spoke
enthusiastically in support of surrendering U.S. fiscal sover-
eignty to the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of
International  Settlements.  Delegates  representing  the  Alpha
ranking Group, a P2 Freemasonry bank, said the United States
must be forced to surrender to "the higher authority of a world
bank," before any progress toward the New World Order could
be made.
   On January 8th, 1983, before their big meeting on January
lOth-11th, Hans Vogel, a leading Club of Rome member, was
received  at the White  House.  President Ronald Reagan  had
invited George  Schultz, Caspar Weinberger, George  Kennan
and Lane Kirkland to be present at his meeting with Vogel, who
explained to President Reagan what the aims and objectives of
the Ditchley Group were. From that day, President Reagan did
an about face and worked with the Committee of 300's various
agencies to advance the International Monetary Fund and the
Bank of International Settlements as the authority on U.S do-
mestic and foreign monetary policies.
   The invisible government of the Committee of 300 has put
tremendous pressure on America to change its ways--for the
worse. America is the last bastion of freedom and unless our
freedoms are taken away from us, progress toward a One World
Government will be considerably slowed. Such an undertaking
as a One World Government is a massive one, requiring a great

                              219

deal of skill, organizing abilities, control of governments and
their policies. The only organization that could possibly have
undertaken this mammoth task with any hope of success is the
Committee of 300, and we have seen just how far it has come
toward total success.
    Above all, the battle is a spiritual one. Unfortunately, the
Christian churches have become little more than social clubs
run by the infinitely evil World Council of Churches (WCC),
whose beginnings lie not in Moscow but in the City of London,
as we see from the chart at the end of the book which gives the
structure of the One World Government Church. This body was
set up in the 1920's to serve as a vehicle for One World Gov-
ernment policies, and stands as a monument to the long-range
planning capabilities of the Committee of 300.
   Another corrupt body similar in structure and design to the
WCC is the Union of Concerned Scientists, set up by the Trilateral
Commission, and funded by the Carnegie Endowment Fund, the
Ford Foundation and Aspen Institute. This is the group that has
led the fight to prevent the United States from mounting an
effective deterrent against Soviet Cosmospheres, space-based
laser beam weapons which can destroy selected targets in the
United States or elsewhere from outer space.
   The United States SDI program was designed to counter the
threat posed by Soviet Cosmospheres, a threat which still exists
in spite of the assurances that "communism is dead." Soviet
spokesman Georgi Arbatov told a meeting of the Union of
Concerned Scientists that it is important for them to oppose the
SDI program, because if the SDI program became operational,
"it will be a military catastrophe." Year after year the Union of
Concerned Scientists has opposed every budget which included
funding for the vital SDI program, until by the end of 1991, there
is not even enough money to fund further research still required
let alone place the system in orbit. The Union of Concerned
Scientists is run by the Royal Institute for International Affairs
and is heavily infiltrated with M16 British intelligence agents.

                              220

   There is not one single aspect of life in America that is not
watched over, steered in the "right" direction, manipulated, and
controlled by the invisible government of the Committee of
300. There is not one elected official or political leader that is
not subject to its rule. No one thus far has got away with defying
our secret rulers, who do not hesitate to make "a horrible ex-
ample" of anyone, including the President of the United States
of America.
   From 1776 when Jeremy Bentham and William Petty, the
Earl of Shelburne, fresh from the triumph of the French Revo-
lution which they planned and ran, were drafted by the British
Crown to bring their combined experience to bear against the
colonists, to 1812 when the British sacked and burned Washing-
ton, destroying secret documents that would have exposed the
treason being worked against the young United States of America
to  the Watergating  of President Nixon  and  assassination  of
President Kennedy, the hand of the Committee of 300 is clearly
visible. This book is an attempt to open the eyes of the American
people to this terrible truth: We are not an independent nation,
nor can we ever be, as long as we are ruled by an invisible
government, the Committee of 300.

   Gets contracts from the National Institute of Health.

MERLE THOMAS CORPORATION
   Gets  contracts  from the  U.S.  Navy,  analyzes  data from

WALDEN RESEARCH
   Does work in the field of pollution control.

PLANNING RESEARCH CORPORATION, ARTHUR D.
LITTLE, G.E. "TEMPO," OPERATIONS RESEARCH
INC.
   Part of approximately 350 firms who conduct research and
conduct surveys, make recommendations to government.
   They are part of what President Eisenhower called "a pos-
sible danger to public policy that could itself become captive of
a scientific-technological elite."

BROOKINGS INSTITUTION
   Dedicates  its  work  to  what  it  calls  a  "national  agenda."
Wrote President Hoover's program, President Roosevelt's  "New
Deal," the Kennedy Administration's "New Frontiers" program
(deviation from it cost John F. Kennedy his life), and President
Johnson's "Great Society." Brookings has been telling the United
States Government how to conduct its affairs for the past 70
years and is still doing so on behalf of the Committee of 300.

                              232

HUDSON INSTITUTE
    Under the direction of Herman Khan, this institution has
done more to shape the way Americans react to political and
social events, think, vote and generally conduct themselves than
perhaps any except the BIG FIVE. Hudson specializes in de-
fense policy research and relations with the USSR. Most of its
military work is classified as SECRET. (One idea during the
Vietnam War was to build a moat around Saigon.) Some of its
earlier papers were entitled "Stability and Tranquility Among
Older Nations," and "Analytical Summary of U.S.  National
Security Policy Issues."
   Hudson prides itself on its diversity; it helped NASA with
its space programs and helped to promote new youth fashions
and ideas, youth rebellion and alienation for the Committee of
300, ostensibly funded by Coca Cola. Hudson may be quite
properly classified as one of the Committee of 300's BRAIN-
WASHING establishments. Some of its nuclear war scenarios
make for very interesting reading and, if they can be obtained, I
would recommend "The 6 Basic Thermonuclear Threats" and
"Possible Outcomes of Thermonuclear War" and one of its more
frightening papers entitled "Israeli-Arab Nuclear War."
   Hudson also does corporate advising for Committee of 300
companies, Rank, Xerox, General Electric, IBM and General
Motors, to name but a few of them, but its really big client
remains the U. S. Department of Defense which includes matters
of civil  defense,  national  security,  military  policy  and  arms
control. To date it has not got into "wet NASA," that is to say,
the National Oceanographic Agency.

NATIONAL TRAINING LABORATORIES
   NTL is also known as the International Institute for Applied
Behavioral Sciences. This institute is definitely a brainwashing
center based on Kurt Lewin principles which include so-called
T-Groups  (training  groups),  artificial  stress  training  whereby
participants suddenly find themselves immersed in defending

                              233

themselves against vicious accusations. NTL takes in the Na-
tional Education Association, the largest teacher-group in the
United States.
    While officially decrying "racism," it is interesting to note
that NTL, working with NEA, produced a paper proposing
education  vouchers  which  would  separate  the  hard-to-teach
children from the brighter ones, and funding would be allocated
according to the number of difficult children who would be
separated from those who progressed at a normal rate. The
proposal was not taken up.

--- Committee of 300 - Part 10 -------------------------------------------


UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, WHARTON
SCHOOL OF FINANCE & COMMERCE
    Founded by Eric Trist, one of the "brain trusts" of Tavistock,
Wharton has become one of the more important Tavistock in-
stitutions in  the U.S. in so far as  "Behavioral  Research" is
concerned. Wharton attracts clients such as the U.S. Department
of Labor--which it teaches how to produce "cooked" statistics
at the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates Incorpo-
rated. This method is very much in demand as we come to the
close of 1991 with millions more out of work than is reflected in
USDL statistics.
   Wharton's ECONOMETRIC MODELING is used by every
major Committee of 300 company in the United States, Western
Europe and by the International Monetary Fund, the United
Nations and the World Bank. Wharton has produced such note-
worthy persons as George Schultz and Alan Greenspan.

INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH
    This is the institute set up by "brain trusters" from Tavistock
Rensis Likert, Dorwin Cartwright and Ronald Lippert. Among
its studies are "The Human Meaning of Social Change," "Youth
in Transition" and "How Americans View Their Mental Health."
Among the institute's clients are The Ford Foundation, U.S.
Department  of Defense,  U.S. Postal  Service  and  the  U.S.
Department of Justice.

                              234

INSTITUTE FOR THE FUTURE
    This is not a typical Tavistock institution in that it is funded
by the Ford Foundation, yet it draws its long-range forecasting
methodology from the mother of all think tanks. Institute for the
Future projects what it believes to be changes that will be taking
place in time frames of fifty years. The institute is supposed to
be able to forecast socioeconomic trends and to blow the whistle
on any departures from what it has laid down as normal.
   Institute for the Future believes it is possible and normal to
intervene now and give decisions for the future. So-called "Delphi
Panels"  decide what is  normal  and what is  not,  and prepare
position papers to "steer" government in the right direction to
head off such groups as "people creating civil disorder." (This
could  be  patriotic  groups  demanding  abolition  of graduated
taxes, or demanding that their right to bear arms is not infringed.)
   The institute recommends actions such as liberalizing abor-
tion laws, drug usage and that cars entering an urban area pay
tolls, teaching birth control in public schools, requiring regis-
tration of firearms, making the use of drugs  a non-criminal
offense, legalizing homosexuality, paying students for scholas-
tic  achievements,  making zoning controls  a preserve  of the
state, offering bonuses for family planning and last, but by no
means least, a Pol Pot Cambodia-style proposal that new com-
munities be  established in rural  areas. As  will be  observed,
many of the Institute for the Future's goals have already been
more than fully realized.

INSTITUTE FOR POLICY STUDIES (IPS)
   One of the "Big Three," IPS has shaped and reshaped United
States policies, foreign and domestic, since it was founded by
James P. Warburg and the Rothschild entities in the United States,
bolstered by Bertrand Russell and the British Socialists through
its networks in America which include the League for Industrial
democracy in which Leonard Woodcock played a leading, if
behind-the-scenes role. Local lead players in the League for

                              235

Industrial Democracy included "conservative" Jeane Kirkpatrick,
Irwin Suall (of the ADL), Eugene Rostow (Arms Control nego-
tiator), Lane Kirkland (Labor leader), and Albert Shanker.
   For record purposes only, IPS was incorporated in 1963 by
Marcus  Raskin  and Richard  Barnett,  both  highly-trained
Tavistock Institute graduates. Most of the funding came from
Rothschild associates in America like the James Warburg Fam-
ily, the Stern Family Foundation and the Samuel Rubin Foun-
dation. Samuel Rubin was a registered member of the Commu-
nist Party who stole the Faberge name (Faberge was "Jeweler of
the Imperial Russian Court") and made a fortune out of the
Faberge name.
   The objectives of IPS came from an agenda laid down for it
by the British Round Table, which agenda in turn came from
Travistock Institute, one of the most notable being to create the
"New Left" as a grass roots movement in the U.S. IPS was to
engender strife and unrest and spread chaos like a wildfire out of
control, proliferate the "ideals" of left wing nihilistic socialism,
support unrestricted use of drugs of all types, and be the "big
stick" with which to beat the United States political establishment.
   Barnett and Raskin controlled such diverse elements as the
Black Panthers, Daniel Ellsberg, National Security Council staff
member  Halperin, The Weathermen  Underground,  the
Venceramos  and  the  campaign  staff of candidate  George
McGovern. No scheme was too big for IPS and its controllers to
take on and manage.
   Take the plot to "kidnap" Kissinger, which was in the hands
of Eqbal Ahmed, a British M16 intelligence agent of Pakistani
origin, laundered through "TROTS" (Trotskyite terrorists based
in London). The "plot" was "discovered" by the FBI so that it
could not go too far. Ahmed went on to become the director of
one of IPS's most influential agencies, The Transnational Insti-
tute  which,  chameleon-like,  changed from  its  former  name,
Institute of Race Relations, when intelligence agents of BOSS
(Bureau of State Security) in South Africa unmasked the fact

                              236

that it was tied directly to Rhodes Scholarship-Harry Oppen-
heimer and Anglo-American-British mining interests in South
Africa. BOSS also discredited the South Africa Foundation at
the same time.
   Through its many powerful lobbying groups on Capitol Hill,
IPS relentlessly used its "big stick" to beat Congress. IPS has a
network of lobbyists, all supposedly operating independently
but in actual fact acting cohesively, so that Congressmen are
pummeled from  all  sides  by  seemingly  different  and  varied
lobbyists. In this way, IPS was, and is still, able to successfully
sway individual Representatives and Senators to vote for "the
trend, the way things are going." By using key point men on
Capitol Hill, IPS was able to break into the very infrastructure of
our legislative system and the way it works.
   To give only a single concrete example of what I am talking
about: in 1975, an IPS point man persuaded representative John
Conyers (D-Michigan) and forty-seven members of the House
to request IPS to prepare a budget study that would oppose the
budget being prepared by President Gerald Ford. Although not
adopted, the request was reinstated in 1976, 1977, and 1978
gathering sponsors as it went.
   Then in 1978, fifty-six Congressmen signed their names to
sponsor an IPS budget study. This was prepared by Marcus
Raskin.  Raskin's budget called for a fifty percent cut in the
Defense Budget, a socialist housing program "that would com-
pete with and steadily replace private housing and mortgage
markets," a national health service, "radical changes in the
educational system that would disrupt capitalist control over the
distribution of knowledge," and several other radical ideas.
   The influence of IPS on Arms Control negotiations was a
major factor in  getting Nixon to  sign the treasonous ABM
Treaty in 1972, which left the United States virtually defense-
less against ICBM attack for almost 10 years. IPS became, and
remains to this day  one of the most prestigious "think tanks"
controlling foreign policy decisions, which we, the people, fool-

                              237

ishly believe are those of our law makers.
   By sponsoring militant activism at home and with links to
revolutionaries abroad, by engineering such victories as "The
Pentagon Papers," besieging the corporate structure, bridging
the credibility gap between underground movements and ac-
ceptable political activism, by penetrating religious organiza-
tions and using them to sow discord in America, such as radical
racial politics under the guise of religion, using the establish-
ment media to spread IPS ideas, and then supporting them, IPS
has lived up to the role which it was founded to play.

STANFORD RESEARCH INSTITUTE
   Jesse Hobson, the first president of Stanford Research Insti-
tute, in a 1952 speech made it clear what lines the institute was
to follow. Stanford can be described as one of the "jewels" in
Tavistock's Crown in its rule over the United States. Founded in
1946 immediately after the close of WW II, it was presided over
by Charles A. Anderson, with emphasis on mind control re-
search and "future sciences." Included under the Stanford um-
brella was Charles F. Kettering Foundation which developed the
"Changing Images of Man" upon which the Aquarian Con-
spiracy rests.
   Some of Stanford's major clients and contracts were at first
centered around the defense establishment but, as Stanford grew,
so did the diversity of its services:
      Applications  of Behavioral  Sciences  to  Research
         Management.
      Office of Science and Technology.
      SRI Business Intelligence Program.
      U.S.  Department of Defense Directorate  of Defense
         Research and Engineering.
      U.S. Department of Defense Office of Aerospace Research.
     Among corporations seeking Stanford's services were Wells
Fargo Bank, Bechtel Corporation, Hewlett Packard, Bank of
America,  McDonnell-Douglas  Corporation,  Blyth,  Eastman

                              238

Dillon  and TRW Company.  One  of Stanford's  more  secret
projects was extensive work on chemical and bacteriological
warfare (CAB) weapons.
   Stanford Research is plugged into at least 200 smaller "think
tanks" doing research into every facet of life in America. This is
known as ARPA networking and represents the emergence of
probably the most far-reaching effort to control the environment
of every individual in the country. At present Stanford's comput-
ers are linked with 2500 "sister" research consoles which in-
clude the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Bell Telephone
Laboratories, U.S. Army Intelligence, the Office of Naval Intel-
ligence (ONI), RANI), MIT, Harvard and UCLA.  Stanford
plays a key role in that it is the "library," cataloging all ARPA
documentation.
   "Other agencies"--and one can use one's imagination here,
are allowed to search through SRI's "library" for key words,
phrases, look through sources and update their own master files
with  those  of Stanford  Research  Center.  The  Pentagon,  for
instance, uses SRI's "master files" extensively, and there is little
doubt that other U.S. Government agencies do the same. Pentagon
"command and control" problems are worked out by Stanford.
   While ostensibly these apply only to weapons and soldiers,
there is absolutely no guarantee that the same research could
not, and will not, be turned to civilian applications. Stanford is
known to be willing to do anything for anyone, and it is my
belief that if ever SRI were to be fully exposed, the hostility
which would arise from revelations as to what it actually does
would most probably force SRI to close.

MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,
ALFRED P. SLOAN SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT
   This major institute is not generally recognized as being a
part of Tavistock U.S.A. Most people look upon it as a purely
American institution, but that is far from being the case. MIT-
Alfred Sloan can be roughly divided into the following groups:

                              239

      Contemporary Technology.
      Industrial Relations.
      Lewin Group Psychology.
      NASA-ERC Computer Research Laboratories.
      Office of Naval Research Group, Psychology.
      Systems Dynamics. Forrestor and Meadows wrote The
         Club of Rome's "Limits of Growth" zero growth
         study.
   Some of MIT's clients include the following:
      American Management Association.
      American Red Cross.
      Committee for Economic Development.
      GTE.
      Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA).
      NASA.
      National Academy of Sciences.
      National Council of Churches.
      Sylvania.
      TRW.
      U.S. Army.
      U.S. Department of State.
      U.S. Navy.
      U.S. Treasury.
      Volkswagen Company.
   So vast is the reach of IDA that it would take hundreds of
pages to describe the activities in which it is engaged, and IDA
is fully described in my book on the role played by Institutions
and Foundations in committing treason against the United States
of America, which will be published early in 1992.

RAND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
CORPORATION
   Without a doubt, RAND is THE think tank most beholden to
Tavistock Institute and certainly the RIIA's most prestigious
vehicle  for control  of United  States policies  at every  level.

                              240

Specific  RAND policies  that became  operative  include  our
ICBM program, prime analyses for U.S. foreign policy making,
instigator of space programs, U.S. nuclear policies, corporate
analyses, hundreds of projects for the military, the Central lntel-
ligence Agency (CIA) in relation to the use of mind altering
drugs like peyote, LSD (the covert MK-Ultra operation which
lasted for 20 years).
   Some of RAND's clients include the following:
      American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T).
      Chase Manhattan Bank.
      International Business Machines (IBM).
      National Science Foundation.
      Republican Party.
      TRW.
      U.S. Air Force.
      U.S. Department of Energy.
      U.S. Department of Health.
   There are literally THOUSANDS of highly important com-
panies, government institutions and organizations that make use
of RAND's services, and to list them all would be an impossible
task. Among RAND's "specialities" is a study group that pre-
dicts the timing and the direction of a thermonuclear war, plus
working out the many scenarios based upon its findings. RAND
was once accused of being commissioned by the USSR to work
out terms  of surrender of the United States Government, an
accusation that went all the way to the United States Senate,
where it was taken up by Senator Symington and subsequently
fell victim to articles of scorn poured out by the establishment
press. BRAIN WASHING remains the primary function of RAND.
   To summarize, the major Tavistock institutions in the United
States engaged in brainwashing at all levels, including govern-
ment, the military, business, religious organizations and educa-
tion are the following:
      Brookings Institution.
      Hudson Institute.

                              241

      Institute for Policy Studies.
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
      National Training Laboratories.
      Rand Research and Development Corporation.
      Stanford Research Institute.
      Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania.
   It is estimated by sources of mine that the total number of
people employed by these institutions is in the region of 50,000
with funding close to $lO billion dollars.
   Some major world-wide Committee of 300 institutions and
organizations are as follows:
  Americans for a Safe Israel.
  Biblical Archaeology Review.
  Bilderbergers.
  British Petroleum.
  Canadian Institute of Foreign Relations.
  Christian Fundamentalism.
  Council on Foreign Relations, New York.
  Egyptian Exploration Society.
  Imperial Chemical Industries.
  International Institute for Strategic Studies.
  Order of Skull and Bones.
  Palestine Exploration Fund.
  Poor Knights of the Templars
  Royal Dutch Shell Company.
  Socialist International.
  South Africa Foundation.
  Tavistock Institute of Human Relations.
  Temple Mount Foundation.
  The Atheist Club.
  The Fourth State of Consciousness Club.
  The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.
  The Milner Group.
  The Nasi Princes.
  The Order of Magna Mater.

                              242

  The Order of the Divine Disorder.
  The RIIA.
  The Round Table.
  Trilateral Commission.
  Universal Freemasonry.
  Universal Zionism.
  Vickers Armament Company.
  Warren Commission.
  Watergate Committee.
  Wilton Park.
  World Council of Churches.

AN INTRODUCTlON TO THE PRINCIPLES AND MORALS
OF LEGISLATION,  Bentham,  Jeremy.  In  this  1780  work
Bentham claimed that "nature has placed mankind under the
governance  of two  sovereign  masters,  pain  and pleasure...
They govern us in all we do." Bentham went on to justify the
horrors of the Jacobin terrorists in the French Revolution.

ANNUAL REPORT OF BANK LEUMI, 1977.

AT THAT POINT IN TIME: THE INSIDE STORY OF THE
SENATE WATERGATE COMMITTEE, Thompson, Fred. I was
told where to find Thompson, who was the Minority Counsel on
the Ervin Committee, by Bernard Barker, one of the Watergate
Burglars. My meeting with Barker took place outside an A&P
supermarket quite close to the Coral Gables Country Club in
Coral Gables, Florida. Barker said Thompson was with his law
partner who was on a short visit to his mother in Coral Gables,
which was only about five minutes away from the A&P Super-
market. I went there and met Thompson who expressed his
disappointment over the way Ervin had imposed such severe
restrictions on evidence he, Thompson, could admit.

BAKU AN EVENTFUL HISTORY, Henry, J. D.

BEASTS OF THE APOCALYPSE, O'Grady, Olivia Maria.
This remarkable book gives details about a large number of
historical figures, including William C. Bullitt, who conspired
with Lloyd George to pull the rug out from under White Russian
Generals Denekin and Rangle at a time when they had the
Bolshevik Red Army on the very brink of defeat. It also gives a
great deal of information about the utterly corrupt Petroleum
Industry. Of particular interest is the information it provides on
Sir Moses Montefiore, of the ancient Venetian Black Nobility
Montefiores.

ERVIN, SENATOR SAM. Apart from obstructing the introduc-
tion of vital evidence in the Watergate hearings, Ervin, in my
opinion, while holding himself out as a Constitutional authority,
consistently  betrayed this  nation  by  opposing  aid  to  church
schools, citing the judicial opinions in the Everson case. Ervin, a
Scottish Rite Freemason--which in my opinion is why he was
given the Watergate Committee chair, was eventually honored
receiving the prestigious Scottish Rite "Individual Right's Sup-
port" award. In  1973, Ervin held a luncheon in the Senate
Dining Room in honor of Sovereign Grand Commander Clausen.

INTRODUCTION TO THE SOCIOLOGY OF MUSIC, Adorno,
Theo. Adorno was kicked out of Germany by Hitler because of
his Cult of Dionysus music experiments.  He was moved to
England by the Oppenheimers where the British royal family
gave him facilities at Gordonstoun School and their support. It
was here  that Adorno perfected "Beatlemusic Rock," "Punk
Rock" "Heavy Metal Rock" and all of the decadent clamor that
passes for music today. It is worthy of note that the name "The
Beatles" was chosen to show a connection between modern
rock, the Isis cult and the Scarab Beatle, a religious symbol of
ancient Egypt.

MEMOIRS OF A BRITISH AGENT, Lockhart, Bruce. In this
book we are told how the Bolshevik Revolution was controlled
out of London. Lockhart was Lord Milner's representative who
went to Russia to watch over Milner's investment in Lenin and
Trotsky. Lockhart had access to Lenin and Trotsky at short
notice even though Lenin frequently had a waiting room full of
high-ranking officials and foreign delegates, some having been
waiting to see him for as long as five days. Yet Lockhart never
had to wait more than a few hours to see either man. Lockhart
carried a letter signed by Trotsky informing all Bolshevik officials
that Lockhart had special status and should be given the utmost
cooperation at all times.

tain their grip on every aspect of church life in this country.

ROOM 3603, Hyde, Montgomery. The book gives some detail
about M16 British Intelligence operations run by Sir William
Stephenson out of the RCA Building in New York; but, as is
usual with "cover stories," the REAL events have been omitted.

SPECIAL RELATIONSHIPS: AMERICA IN PEACE AND
WAR, Wheeler-Bennet, Sir John.

THE CHASM AHEAD, Peccei, A.

THE DlARIES OF SIR BRUCE LOCKHART, Lockhart, Bruce.

THE ENGINEERING OF CONSENT, Bernays. In this 1955
book, Bernays lays out the modus operandi of how to persuade
targeted groups to change their minds on important issues that
can and do alter the national direction of a country. The book
also deals with the unleashing of psychiatric shock troops such
as we see in lesbian and homosexual organizations, environ-
mental groups, abortion rights groups and the like. "Psychiatric
shock troops" was a concept developed by John Rawlings Reese,
the founder of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations.

THE FEDERAL BUDGET AND SOCIAL RECONSTRUC-
TION, IPS Fellows Raskin and Barnett. A list of members of
Congress who asked IPS to produce the alternative budget study
and/or supported it is too long to include here but contained
such prominent names as Tom Harkness, Henry Ruess, Patricia
Schroeder,  Les Aspin,  Ted Weiss,  Don Edwards,  Barbara
Mikulski, Mary Rose Oakar, Ronald Dellums and Peter Rodino.

THE HUXLEYS, Clark.

THE IMPERIAL DRUG TRADE, Rowntree.

THE JESUITS, Martin, Malachi.

Cleveland, Harlan. Cleveland was commissioned by NATO to
report on just how far the Club of Rome's Post Industrial

                              260

Society-Zero Growth blueprint to wreck the industrial base of
the United States had succeeded. This shocking document should
be read by every patriotic American who feels an urgent need
for an explanation as to why the U.S. is in a deep economic
depression at the end of 1991.

THE MEN WHO RULED INDIA, Woodruff, Philip.

THE OPEN CONSPIRACY, Wells, H. G. In this work, Wells
describes how in the New World Order (which he calls the New
Republic) "useless eaters," excess population, will be gotten rid
of: "The men of the New Republic will not be squeamish either
in facing or inflicting death.... They will have an ideal that will
make killing worthwhile; like Abraham, they will have the faith
to kill, and they will have no superstitions about death.... They
will hold, I anticipate, that a certain portion of the population
exists only on sufferance out of pity and patience, and, on the
understanding that they do not propagate, and I do not foresee
any reason to oppose that they will not hesitate to kill when that
sufferance is abused.... All such killings will be done with an
opiate.... If deterrent punishments are used at all in the code of
the future, the deterrent shall be neither death, nor mutilation of
the body...but good  scientifically  caused pain."  The  United
States has a very large contingent of Wells converts who would
not hesitate to follow the dictates of Wells, once the New World
Order becomes a reality. Walter Lippmann was one of Wells'
most ardent disciples.

THE POLITICS OF EXPERIENCE, Laing, R.D. Laing was the
Staff Psychologist at Tavistock and, under Andrew Schofield, a
member of the Governing Council.

THE POLITICS OF HEROIN IN SOUTH EAST ASIA, McCoy,
Alfred W., Read, C.B and Adams, Leonard P.

THE PROBLEM OF CHINA, Russell, Bertrand.

                              261

THE PUGWASH CONFEREES, Bertrand Russell. In the early
1950's Russell led a movement urging  a nuclear attack on
Russia. When it was discovered, Stalin warned that he would
not hesitate to retaliate in kind. This led to a quick "rethink" on
he part of Russell, who almost overnight became a pacifist
thus was born the "Ban the Bomb" Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament (CND) out of which arose the Pugwash anti-
nuclear scientists. In 1957 the first group met at the home of
Cyrus Eaton in Nova Scotia, a long-time American Communist.
The Pugwash Conferees dedicated themselves to anti-nuclear
and environmental issues and were a thorn in the side of U.S.
efforts to develop nuclear weapons.

THE ROUND TABLE MOVEMENT AND IMPERIAL
UNION, Kendle, John.

THE STRUCTURE OF THE POPULAR MUSIC INDUSTRY;
THE FILTERING PROCESS WHEREBY RECORDS ARE
SELECTED FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION, Institute for So-
cial Research. This work explains how "Hit Parades," "The Top
Ten"--now expanded to the "Top Forty"--and other charades
are constructed to deceive listeners and convince them what
they hear is what "THEY" like!

THE WORKS OF JEREMY BENTHAM, Bowering, John.
Bentham was the liberal of his day  and the agent for Lord
Shelburne, British Prime Minister at the end of the American
War of Independence. Bentham believed that man was no more
than a common animal, and Bentham's theories were later writ-
ten up by his protege, David Hume. Writing about instinct in
animals Hume said, "...which we are so apt to admire as extra-
ordinary and inexplicable. But our wonder will perhaps cease or
diminish when  we consider that the experimental reasoning
itself which we possess in common with beasts, and upon which
the whole conduct of life depends, is nothing but a species of

                              262

instinct, or mechanical power that acts in us unknown to our-
selves.... Though the instincts be different, yet still it is an
instinct."

TIME PERSPECTIVE AND MORALE, Levin B.

TOWARD A HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY, Cantril.

TREND REPORT, Naisbitt, John.

U.S. CONGRESS, HOUSE COMMITTEE ON INTERNAL
SECURITY, REPORTING ON THE INSTITUTE FOR POLICY
STUDIES (IPS) AND THE PENTAGON PAPERS. In the spring
of 1970, FBI operative William McDermott went to see Richard
Best, who at that time was Rand's top security officer, to warn
him of the possibility that Ellsberg had removed Vietnam study
papers done by Rand and had copied them outside of Rand
premises. Best took McDermott to see Dr. Harry Rowan who
headed Rand and who was also one of Ellsberg's closest friends.
Rowan told the FBI that a Defense Department inquiry was
going on and on his assurance, the FBI apparently dropped its
investigation of Ellsberg. In fact, no inquiry was in progress, nor
did the DoD ever conduct one. Ellsberg retained his security
clearance at Rand and blatantly went on removing and copying
Vietnam War documents right up to the time of his exposure
during  the  Pentagon  Papers  affair  which  rocked  the  Nixon
Administration to its foundations.

UNDERSTANDING MAN'S SOCIAL BEHAVIOR, Cantril.
Cantril was primarily responsible for establishing the Association
for Humanistic Psychology based in San Francisco that taught
Tavistock methods. It is in institutions of this type that we find
the lines between pure science and social engineering become
totally obliterated. The term "social engineering" covers every
aspect of methods used by Tavistock to bring about massive

                              263

charges in group orientation toward social, economic, religious
and political events and brainwashing of target groups who then
believe that opinions expressed and viewpoints taken are their
own.  Selected individuals  underwent the  same  Tavistockian
treatment, resulting in major shifts in personality and behavior.
The effect of this on the national scene was, and still is, devastat-
ing and is one of the principal factors in bringing the United
States into the twilight, decline and fall state-of-being in which
the country finds itself at the close of 1991. I did a report on this
national condition under the title: "Twilight, Decline and Fall of
the United States of America" which was published in l987.
The Association for Human Psychology  was  founded by
Abraham Maselov in l957 as a Club of Rome project. Another
Tavistock-Club  of Rome Commissioned opinion-making
research center was established by Risis Likhert and Ronald
Lippert who called it The Center for Research in the Utilization
of Scientific Knowledge. The facility was under the directorship
of Club of Rome's Donald Michael. The center drew heavily on
the Office of Public Opinion Research established at Princeton
University in l940. It was from here that Cantril taught many of
the techniques used by today's pollsters-opinion makers.

UNPUBLlSHED LETTERS, Kipling, Rudyard. Kipling was a
Wells disciple and, like Wells, believed in Fascism, as a means of
world control. Kipling adopted the Running Cross as his per-
sonal emblem. The Running Cross was later adopted by Hitler
and with slight modifications became known as the swastika.

UNPUBLISHED LETTERS, Wells, H. G.  Gives interesting
details of how Wells sold the rights to "WAR OF THE WORLDS"
to RCA.

WHO OWNS MONTREAL, Aubin, Henry.

WHO'S WHO IN CANADA, several editions.
