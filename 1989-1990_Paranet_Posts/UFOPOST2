It's nice to hear from you, Marty.  I hadn't realized this echo
reached all the way to Brisbane.
   In answer to your question: You were absolutely right!  What
you heard from a friend is most likely an exaggeration.  I talked
with a high level member of CSETI today, and was assured that the
group is very, very much in tune with what's going on, but has
heard nothing about any 10 foot flyovers with TV cameras whirring.
It certainly hasn't happened when teams from CSETI were out.
There have been close encounters -- but not that close.
  In the case of an encounter at Gulf Breeze, Florida earlier
this year, several craft moved in toward the CSETI team and
came within less than a mile.
  In an even more spectacular, recent encounter near Mexico City,
a giant, triangular shaped craft, estimated to be several
hundred feet wide, appeared to begin a landing approach, coming
to within 1,500 feet at an altitude of 300 feet before it finally
veered away.  Signals of flashing lights were exchanged between
the craft and the CSETI group.  There may have been an even closer
encounter in England while Dr. Greer was in a crop circle, but I
don't know the details.
  By the term "torch" do you mean the same thing we would call a
"flashlight"?  If so, that IS one of the signalling devices
that Greer and his group use (it's at least a million candle power,
I believe).  And CSETI also uses techniques which could be termed
"telepathic" to vector exterrestrial craft in.  Despite allegations
that the contacts have been staged by the government, the key
members of CSETI definitely believe that their numerous Close
Encounters have been the real thing -- actual communication with
aliens aboard space vehicles.
  Regarding the reports that there are lots of aliens on this planet
who, at one time or another, were in cahoots with the government --
and now may be out of control -- CSETI doesn't lend such reports much
credibility, refusing to buy into the "Grays are going to get us"
mentality.  (Is it possible that some folks find it profitable to
promote FEAR?)  The fact of the matter may be that our government is
as confused as anybody about this issue, even though it probably does
have some alien hardware, and maybe even some alien bodies.
  Interesting stuff, isn't it?
