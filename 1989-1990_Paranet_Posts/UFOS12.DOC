Jim You say I am replying on a very limited knowledge base. This is simply not
so. I have obtained every published report of the incident from STARPORT in
old Greenwich CT at 203-698-0588. The sysop there (Jim Bolster) has received
or downloaded from Jim's board here, every published report that came out on
the incident and I subsequently took them as well. My knowledge, unlike Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle (who believed in the fairies you may recall), is
substantial in ASTRONOMY and PHYSICS. From that base I speak from. I had lunch
with James Randi Monday evening and I discussed at length with him the reports
and the witness sightings. For each event you see both he and I agree on one
point: You approach the event with an open mind, which is what I do. When I
say something you dont want to hear, you shut it out. It is a common problem
with someone who has the 'will to believe' (Flim-Flam by James Randi CHapter
10) that facts are found to be disputable . In the erie incident case you are
bound by (lets call them) SIMILARITIES to an astronomical event to dismiss the
incident and pursue more non-astronomical type events, which says that if all
UFO inhabitants decided to look like VENUS then we would never have a hope of
finding them! Remember we are fighting ourselves here. Puthoff and Targ forged
para-psychology results to make magician Uri Geller look like someone other
than the fake he is. Even with documented proof he is a phony, people STILL
BELIEVE HE HAS POWERS. My goodness, how much proof does one need!!!!

One last thing. In these 'scientific investigations' I find many people
including yourself using the old CATCH 22 type statements that attempt to
remove the subject (a UFO sighting for example) from the realm of explanation.

(cont) Such phrases when you find yourself using them should spark in you that
you are jumping to conlusions as Targ did and not approaching things
scientifically. If you say that you are not, based on print outs of past
conversations with you, I would have to say that you should re-examine the
methods with which you approach the subject. If you find yourself not
believing it to be Venus or admitting the possibility anyway, then you are in
need of a few lessons in scientific methods which I will be happy to assist
with (this is NOT meant to be insulting). James Randi's ideas are not mine,
but he does design very good analyses. I try to take after his approach.

James Try it before asking what happens if it doesnt work first. Also note
that the tone of your statement indicates that your preconceived notion that
the moon is larger will taint your results of course. I suggest letting an
unbiased person do it and not tell them the point!

Joe you are absolutely right! I made an assumption when I told James Vincent
what I told him. I assumed that he would not be in a location that would allow
him to see all the way to the horizon where the effect is most pronounced.
After the moon rises approximately 8-12 degrees above the horizon, the effect
is all but gone. That is the proper point from which to do the test. I admit
it is a simple test but it is very very quick. Using photos takes longer but
truly removes all doubt! Very good reply. Marc

I like that explaination.  However, I have never heard of Jim's experience
that was similar to that.  There was this one other time, about a week later,
when I thought it had happened again but right in front of my eyes this time. 
I was going out on the one road that intersects with Indian Bend between
Hayden and Pima.  There's a median with bushes in it.  Well, as I was
travelling up the road, a car turned left onto the street I was on (opposite
direction), and it seemed to disappear.    It never came head-on on the other
side of the road.  Being the skeptic that I am, I immediatly assumed that the
Christian "Rapture" was happening, but only to people in cars.  Then it dawned
on me that what had really happened in this case was that the car was behind
the bushes, and managed to stay so because we were moving in opposite
directions, so that we passed the bushes at the same time.

Ok Ill buy that. You have made a good point there. I do recall that you did
use the catch 22 when in one of your first messages (I have it here somewhere)
you said that the technology was something we could not possibly understand ;
however, I understand that sometimes even the best investigators get caught in
there own mud (myself included of course). My concern was in the delivery you
were making regarding the incident. You may say you are open minded (as I
have) but *really* sub-conciously or conciously believed the incident to be a
true UFO incident and the rest of the argument followed from there. I too
admit in re-reading my responses that it seems that I believed it to be Venus
from the start as well! Shame on that appearance. Anyway, my further concern
is that you understand my last point in a previous response: Since this
incident is more readily explainable as an astronomical phenomena (without
much reaching) we (both of us) are bound to release it from scrutiny and wait
for the big one so to speak. Some incidents are REALLY reaching when they
propose an astronomical solution and those I would say should be pursued , but
Erie? Nah... Marc

Nice to see that you understand that I am not promoting the ET theory on the
one hand but still suprised that you somehow conclude that I ssubconsciously
or consciously believed it to be a true UFO.  I have yet to see enough
evidence for any claimed UFO incident to convince me it was, in fact a ET-UFO.
 Their is absolutely no doubt that there are true UFO incidents that are not
the result of mis-identified planets; that doesn't mean that 1) they are
ET-UFO's or that 2)they don't have a prosaic explanation but we may never
figure it out.  It is *possible* that there are and have been, ET-UFO
sightings among the unexplained UFO sightings.  I really don't see how you can
continue to think it is so readily explanable as an astronomical phenomenon in
the face of so many statements to the contrary.  It is only so readily
explanable by discounting statements of the witnesses as to location, hieght,
size, movement, colors, and thier previous observations of the planets.  In
addition, you must also discount the photos taken by others of the
"triangles", photos that were reported taken prior to these witnesses reports.
 You must also be willing to believe that not only were multiple "civilian"
witnesses fooled for hours on end, but that skeptical Coast Guard witnesses
were also readily fooled for a substantial period of time.  Incidently, I have
asked you to provide your explantion of how these coast guard people were so
readily fooled in two previous posts.  It seems to be a question you prefer
not to have to address.  You also never addressed the disparity between the
location of the planets, and the reported location of the UFO that was pointed
out by Jim Speiser way back at the begining of this thread.

            UNUSUAL REPORT OF A UFO AND A GREEN-FACED ENTITY
              SEEN NEAR AN OLD U.S.A.F. NIKE MISSLE BASE

     DATE:      June 24, 1988
          
     TIME:      Sometime between 12:30 and 2:00 A.M. Pacific Daylight Time
     
     LOCATION:  Redmond, Washington
     
     DURATION:  Estimates vary, around 7 minutes for sighting of UFO;
                about 45 minutes total duration including sighting of 
                face, possibly longer
     
     SOURCE OF SIGHTING:     UFO Information Service (Goudie)
     
     INVESTIGATORS:          Donald A. Johnson, Ph.D., MUFON
                             Don Olson, MUFON
                             Rita Andreeva, MUFON

     Four 11-year-old girls who had attended a private Christian 
elementary school together were having a slumber party reunion at the 
home of one of the girls on Education Hill in Redmond, Washington.  At 
a few minutes after either 12:30 AM or 1:30 AM they were looking out 
the window to see if they could find the girl's dog.  They were 
downstairs in the TV room, while the parents and brother and sister of 
the host were asleep upstairs.  They witnessed a craft-like UFO, 
described as either a domed-disc or two plates put together edge-to-
edge, hovering in the night sky.  It had white and red lights and 
possibly faint green lights around the rim of the object.  Of the two 
girls interviewed, both thought right away that it was a UFO (i.e. 
"spacecraft"), and not an aircraft because it was similar to a picture 
they had once seen in a book.  

     The UFO was hovering at about 30 degrees above the horizon when 
first sighted.  It was described as smaller than a house in size, 
possibly 25 feet in diameter.  The UFO moved to the right horizontally 
about 10 degrees, reversed direction abruptly and moved back in a 
straight line to the left 10 degrees, moved back to the right 5 
degrees to a center position, and then moved really fast straight 
down.  It moved down behind some tall evergreen trees and the girls 
thought that it probably came down in a clearing in Nike Park, about 
3-4 blocks from the girl's home where they were staying.  The UFO was 
reported to be visible through the window of the TV room for a total 
of between 2 and 7 minutes.

     Some time later, within 15 minutes to a half an hour, two of the 
girls witnessed a frightening face.  The accounts of how the face 
appeared to them varies.  In one account the girls thought they saw 
something like a shadow or a figure at the top of the stairs leading 
up to the kitchen.  The became scared and hid in their sleeping bags; 
they zipped them over their heads and lay next to each other.  They 
conversed through the bags and agreed to look at the same time, so 
that it would not be too scary.  As they pulled the bags down from 
over their heads they saw a dark, mossy green face only about arm's 
length away.  Really frightened, one of the girls pulled the sleeping 
bag over her head, and when she looked out again in a few minutes, the 
being was gone.  The other girl's account said they were lying on 
their backs trying to get to sleep and staring up at the ceiling when 
all of a sudden they both saw this green face.  She watched it for 
about 45 seconds, "and then it just, went away".  Asked if it just 
vanished like it was a slide from a projector or something, she said, 
no, it wasn't like that.  It was just like a real face, but it was 
green in color and it was looking at them.  The second girl appears to 
be unclear about how the face appeared because she also reports she 
covered her head with the sleeping bag at one point but can't remember 
when.  

     The face was described as greenish in hue, with red, glowing 
eyes.  Interviewed separately, both of the girls said there was 
something like a dent in one of the cheeks.  One girl said it looked 
like the "face on Mars" photograph she saw in the newspaper about a 
week later, while the other girl said it had pointy ears and bushy 
eyebrows.  When asked a direct question later about the pointed ears, 
the second girl said she didn't remember any ears.  If the face had 
indeed been attached to a body, one girl figures that the being must 
have been about 3 1/2 to 4 feet tall.  

     About 10 to 15 minutes later the second girl, who lived there, 
saw a clump of rainbow colored lights slowly revolving in her kitchen 
and flashing light all over the ceiling and refrigerator.  The first 
girl made a vague reference to lights in the kitchen but apparently 
did not see the rainbow-colored clump of lights hovering in the 
kitchen (the kitchen is partially visible from the TV room, up half a 
flight of stairs).  

     The girls became noisy discussing what they had seen woke the 
mother.  The mother came down and ordered them to go to sleep.  
Apparently nothing further happened that night.  

     Of the other two girls, they are certain that one saw what they 
saw but would not consent to be interviewed by UFO investigators.  
They are unsure what the fourth girl saw.  The second girl, the one at 
whose home the events occurred, reported that she had had a 
precognitive experience during that previous day, recalling during a 
croquet match that she had dreamed those exact events some weeks 
before.  She also reports that since the UFO incident she is no longer 
subject to nose bleeds, which she reports have occurred to her 
chronically throughout her life and also occur with her father.  She 
also said that a soccer injury to her knee no longer gave her any pain 
after the encounter, and she attributes the healing to the event.

     The neighborhood in which her home is located borders an old Air 
Force Nike Missle base.  Part of the property is now a Washington 
State National Guard facility, part of it is deserted and belongs to 
the local school district, and part of it has been converted to a 
park.  We talked to a staff sargent on the National Guard base who 
reported that he was sleeping at the base on the night in question and 
recalls nothing unusual.  He reported that light aircraft tend to use 
the base as a landmark and so overflights are frequent, and, during 
the daytime hours, hot air balloons frequently come over the base from 
the Sammamish River valley to land in some clearings to the east.

UFO GROUP FASCINATED BY GULF BREEZES SIGHTINGS

      02/28/88
      GULF BREEZES, FL (UPI) [Via Moseley/Saucer Smear] -- A man who took 
21 photos of objects he says are flying saucers and claims he has twice 
seen diminutive aliens has generated interest from a group that 
investigates UFO sightings.
      Mutual UFO Network, or MUFON, in Texas says the Panhandle case is 
either an elaborate hoax or one of the most amazing encounters ever. The 
key is "Ed," a home builder with bizarre tales of encounters he claims are 
continuing.
      In the March edition of MUFON's "UFO Journal," investigators       
offer one possible explanation for why Ed is privy to sightings: aliens 
may have placed an implant in his head in an abduction years ago, and the 
implant is now being activated.
      Hoax or not, it's garnered a lot of interest from a local weekly.
      It all began when the Gulf Breeze Sentinel on Nov. 19 published 
Polaroid photos of a glowing object. The anonymous photographer claimed 
they were taken Nov. 11. He said he would come forward if others saw the 
same thing.
      The following week the paper published accounts from other residents 
who claimed they saw a similar object, and other photos taken by two other 
anonymous photographers.
      The newspaper has had nearly weekly updates ever since. This week 
the paper published a four-page insert with more photos and an open letter 
from "Ed." In addition to a picture purporting to show a UFO with a light 
beam shining down, the insert has a drawing of a 4-foot-tall alien with 
almond shaped eyes and carrying a silver wand.
      Two daily newspapers that previously ignored the sightings last week 
ran stories, and a local television station had a three-part series about 
Ed's sightings. The editor of the Gulf Breeze paper said he has talked to 
reporters from Miami and Orlando and the National Enquirer in Lantana.
      The photographs have been scrutinized by many people who claim to be 
photo experts. Some say they are the real thing, others say they are set 
up. None has said how they were doctored.
      Ed's reliability is the key, and he has made some incredible claims.
      The article in the MUFON publication said it was premature to make a 
judgment about the validity of the case, but does call the sightings an 
"incredible UFO photographic and CE-III (Close Encounter of the Third 
Kind) case."
      It describes in detail 13 alleged encounters "Ed" had. They range 
from hearing a "humming" in his head to a Jan. 12 incident where he claims 
he was stopped by a UFO that landed in front of his truck and saw five 
aliens approaching.
      He left, in great haste.
      On several other occasions, Ed claims he was caught in a blue beam 
that held him fast in place. Once it levitated him toward their craft, 
then let him go for reasons unknown.
      He has also told investigators he has heard voices, telling him not 
to be afraid and to stop resisting. He claims he is tipped off to the UFOs 
appearance by a humming sound in his head.
      Because of the humming sound, MUFON investigators have supplied Ed 
with a two-way radio so he can tell them when an experience occurs. He has 
done so, but so far no investigators have seen a UFO.
      The MUFON article ventured to theorize about why Ed has been singled 
out.
      "There is a possibility that Ed may have had an implant installed in 
his head at some time in his life" that was only recently activated, the 
article said.
      The MUFON article said it normally does not publish sighting reports 
until being thoroughly investigated. But it said it was making an 
exception because it is an "ongoing" case with continuing sightings.

Gulf Breezes Sentinel
Volume 28, Number 49
November 19, 1988

[The following letter was printed in the above periodical. It was accompanied
by three photos showing an object with port hole like spots around it
periphery.  The quality is superb considering it is a photocopy of the
original newspaper.  Here in lies the story.]

"To Whom it May Concern:

  On the night of November 11th I took the pictures you now see before you.  I
was reluctant at first to show them to any one but my family but my wife
convinced me to show them to Ed.  Ed in turn said that the photos should be
shown to the press.  That is why he is presenting them to you.
  I had just sat down to dinner when I saw the object from my window.  I
rushed to my bedroom to get my Polaroid.  I rushed outside and started taking
pictures.  I got off four pictures (5,6,7,8) and then had to change film.  I
got one more good picture (1) before it shot straight up and disappeared.
  There may be some reasonable explanation for what I saw but I don't think
so.  The "ship" looked about the size of a small house.  It was, however,
quite some distance away and hard to tell.  It hovered in the sky for several
minutes and then left.  It did not spin or rotate but it did seem to bob up
and down while weaving slightly.  It glowed from the bottom as if that may be
the power source.  The markings (windows?) on the top there appeared to be a
dome or bump that was quite bright.  There was nothing colorful about it - no
flashing lights, no beams coming from it.  None of that "Star Wars" stuff; it
was just a dull gray-blue "thing".
  I don't think that it was military but you may want to check  It was quite
big and I don't think I was alone in seeing it. I wish to remain anonymous but
if these photos and story spark any interest from your readership I may
identify myself.  I am a prominent citizen of the community however and need
anonymity at this time.  I know what I saw and would feel much better if I
know if I was not alone.
  Let me reassure you that this is not a hoax.  I saw what I saw, took
pictures of it, and have given these pictures to you.  I wish I could come
forward but can not; for while I have nothing to gain, I have everything to
lose. Thank you for your time and understanding."

                   GULF BREEZE, FLORIDA ACTIVITY SUMMARY
                            (As of May 1, 1988)

A.    Biased one-sided investigation

      1.   The  principal  investigators  have made public statements auth-
      enticating  the  photographs  prior to the conclusion of the investi-
      gation. (Attachment #1, "For the Record" dated April 25, 1988)
      
      2.   Negative  aspects  of  the  reported  events  in and around Gulf 
      Breeze,  Florida have been restricted and covered-up by principal in-
      vestigators.  In  fact,  the  investigators have actually taken sides 
      with  the photographer of the objects to the point of furnishing that 
      photographer with internal correspondence pertaining to the investig-
      ation  and  research  of the reported events. (Attachment #2, corres-
      pondence referenced or distributed on a limited basis.)
      
      
B.    Questionable factors concerning principal witness/es

      1.   The  principal witness made his initial report to the _Sentinel_ 
      newspaper;  not  to an official agency such as the police department, 
      for  whatever  reason he may give. This is a factor always considered 
      when  reviewing  a  UFO report. In the Hickson/Parker case, for exam-
      ple,  the  two  witnesses  went first to Keesler AFB, Mississippi and 
      then to the local police department. (Report content)
      
      2.   No known person independent of the principal witness has report-
      edly  observed  the  same object/s, despite the number of photographs 
      taken, in presence of the photographer.
      
      3.   The  witness  has been writing and submitting manuscripts to Mr. 
      Budd  Hopkins' agent, Ms. Phyllis Wender, for possible publication of 
      a  book.  (Correspondence  from Mr. Donald Ware, Mr. Budd Hopkins and 
      verbal confirmation by the photographer)
      
      4.   Some  residents  in the Gulf Breeze, Florida area have related a 
      number  of  disturbing  incidents  in regard to the principal witness 
      that  causes  concern to several investigators and researchers in the 
      UFO  phenomenon community. One example is a statement alleged to have 
      been  made  during  the  summer of 1987 by the witness: "The Ultimate 
      Prank". (Interview with sources by four witnesses.)
      
      5.   The witness has not impressed me, as well as other investigators 
      and  researchers,  of  having  had a truly traumatic experience. (De-
      rived  from  several  personal  visits with the witness,a review of a 
      fairly lengthy video tape and investigation report content)
      
      
C.    Conflicting  and  inconsistent  characteristics  to actual known pat-
      terns of the UFO phenomenon
      
      1.   The  area  in which the majority of related experiences are said 
      to  have  taken place is a heavily populated residential and business 
      location.  The great majority of high quality UFO encounters occur in 
      rural areas away from such populated areas.
      
      2.  The number of reports made by local residences were prompted pri-
      marily  by  the news media (assisted by the principal investigators). 
      Flaps  or  waves  (large distribution of sighting reports over a geo-
      graphical  area) created by the phenomenon itself cover a larger area 
      than  what has occurred in the Gulf Breeze/Pensacola reports. This is 
      additional  evidence that the reports were primarily generated by the 
      news  media  although  some  of  the independent sighting reports may 
      very well be legitimate reports.
      
      3.   Although  one experience related by the witness involved an "at-
      tack"  by the UFO as it moved over and in front of his vehicle (in an 
      isolated  location  for  that  particular incident) there were no E/M 
      effects  reported.  Also, the progression of events are dissimilar to 
      other low level encounters in higher quality cases.
      
      4.   Repeated  sightings  and  experiences related by the witness are 
      similar  to  other  questionable  reports  and "contactee" claims. In 
      most  high  quality  reports  the  witness experiences a single short 
      duration  encounter.  In  longer term encounters the witness/es often 
      relate a time and/or memory lapse following the experience.
      
      5.   Repeated  abilities  by  the witness of being able to resist the 
      anomaly  (UFO/occupants)  have  been claimed. This is contrary to the 
      results of studies in the field.
      
      6.   Several  similarities  with Mr. Whitley Strieber's book _Commun-
      ion_  have  been  found.  The  most curious similarity is the related 
      smell  of  "Cinnamon"  with the Gulf Breeze report which can be found 
      on  Page  19 of Mr. Strieber's book. This is the only known reference 
      to  that  smell  in UFO literature to date. It is also of interest to 
      note  that the book _Communion_ was released during the winter/spring 
      of  1987  and  that  on  page 11 of Mr. Strieber's book he states: "I 
      have never seen an Unidentified Flying Object."
      
      7.   The  abundance of photographs taken by the witness is a negative 
      aspect  in  itself contrary to the actual exhibits of the UFO phenom-
      enon.  Most  high  controversy reports involve a large number of pic-
      tures -- especially when the photographer claims to be a contactee.
      
      8.   The majority of high-quality photographs depicting disc or vert-
      ically  positioned  cylindrical-shaped objects do not exhibit propul-
      sion units as shown in the Gulf Breeze, Florida photographs.
      
      9.   The  objects  depicted in the Gulf Breeze photographs are always 
      tilted  in  a  manner showing a portion of the base but never the top 
      towards  the  camera.  This  is also a curious feature because of the 
      number of photographs taken.
      
      
D.    Questionable factors concerning the photographs
      
      1.   The  first  5  photographs  taken  on November 11, 1987 depict a 
      rapidly  darkening  of  the  sky  that is not consistent with the 3-4 
      minute duration that the witness related.
      
      2.   Accurate  cloud  movement data for the altitude depicted has not 
      been  completed  although there are questions concerning the speed of 
      the  clouds  in the first 5 pictures. Mr. Ray Stanford (PSI) informed 
      me  this date that he has reinstated has analysis of weather data and 
      that  information supported by documents from weather bureau stations 
      will be provided in the near future.
      
      
E.    Inherent flaws with the depicted object/s
      
      1.   The  circular  base  at  the bottom of the object is tilted in a 
      manner  that  creates  a non-symmetrical ellipse. An ellipse must al-
      ways  be  symmetrical.  There are, however, certain factors caused by 
      the  atmosphere  and  photographic  lens  that may reduce imaging the 
      true symmetry of an ellipse.
      
      2.   There  is  an  ambient light on the entire surface of the object 
      depicted  in the first 5 photographs (especially in photograph no. 5) 
      that  can  not  be  easily  attributed  to  sky light (reflected from 
      clouds  at  a  distance),  the  object  itself, the moon, the sun, or 
      local  utility lighting. This indicates the possibility of artificial 
      illumination by the photographer.
      
      3.   There  is  a distinct flaw at the base of the object on the out-
      side  edge  of the rim. This is evident in photograph numbers 11, 14, 
      and 17.
      
      4.   In  photograph  number 16 inside the bottom base of the object a 
      circular  light  is  visible.  There  is a dimmed area visible at one 
      portion  of  that circular light which is similar to a kitchen fluor-
      escent  light where an electrical connection may be. Mr. Ray Stanford 
      (PSI)  is  conducting  comparative  research  with such lighting fix-
      tures.
      
      5.   There  is possible evidence of an overlap between the object and 
      a  tree  in photograph number 7. The object appears to be in front of 
      the  tree or integrated with the tree itself. Dr. Willy Smith is con-
      ducting analysis of this photograph as well as others.
      
      6.  The object depicted in the first 5 photographs appears to be non-
      symmetrical;  that is, the upper and lower portions of the object are 
      off-center  from  one  another. This may be caused by reflections off 
      of  a  glass surface or another form of medium between the object and 
      the lens of the camera.
      
      7.   According  to Dr. Willy Smith (UNICAT Project) there is at least 
      one  "window"  that does not line up horizontally with adjacent "win-
      dows" on the object.
      
      8.   The  spacing between the "windows" on the object are not propor-
      tional  to  one  another horizontally. This is obvious to the unaided 
      eye  and measurements reveal mathematical inconsistencies contrary to 
      good geometry.

ED SHARES PAST YEAR'S EXPERIENCES ON UFO SIGHTING'S
ANNIVERSARY

     On Nov. 11, 1987, as I opened the front door and stared at the
glowing object partly obscured by several pine trees, I stepped
into a phenomena that jolted me to the reality of UFOs.  A
phenomena that is being witnessed all over the world and here
at home by dozens of our fellow residents.  This reality may be
hard to accept for those who have not had a sighting, so I do not
try to convince or persuade.  I have only reported my personal
sightings and incidents as they happened.

     The resulting photographs and video tape I took of the UFO
have been validated by computer imaging (Dr. Maccabee, physicist
with the U.S. Navy).  And, of course, there are otheres who feel
differently and offer little other than opinions. 

     When I was asked to use a 4 lens Nimslo 3-D sealed camera,
I did.  When I was asked to use the SRS (Self Referencing Stereo)
camera, I did.  The technical analysis of these photographs 
produced page after page of data with the end result detailing an
object 14 foot in diameter at the bottom ring and 475 feet distant.

     The accusation of hoax came fast from those unable to say
"maybe", and I was asked to take a lie detector test.  Again the
ridicule was hurled toward me and yet another lie detector test.

     As the controversy swirled, I began to hear preposterous tales
being spread by the debunkers about devil parties and "ultimate
pranks," etc.  Those of you who know me will certainly laugh at 
such claims, but the object was to discredit me in the eyes of those 
who don't know me.  There was a very serious attempt  to destroy
my reputation by twisting spooky party games into ritual seances.
Having failed to discredit the photographic evidence, the out of
town critics have mounted a slander campaign hoping to brand me.
Thank you Gulf Breeze for ignoring these outrageous rumors.

     Some of you may remember the front page headline "Expert
says Photos a Hoax."  The next day the "expert" publicly retracted
his claim and apologized.  A counterintelligence agency in
Maryland was given an audio tape of me being interviewed.  The
resulting examination of the tape on a PSE (Psychological Stress
Evaluator) vindicated my word once more when the examiner 
said the result "does not show any reaction to cause this examiner
to doubt his (Ed's) answers."

     Soon I began to understand that no matter how many tests I
was subjected to and how many times the photographs were
analyzed, I was still open game for the out of town media and 
clearly a target to be ridiculed by the out of town debunkers.  
Many distant newspapers and TV crews played "hide and seek"
with reporting the accurate details, and several times I have
been blackmailed in their quest for a scoop to expose my name.

     The official MUFON investigation was even infiltrated early
by a debunker who took a liquid sample suspected to have fallen
from the UFO for analysis only to issue a false report.  Later the
sample was analyzed by an independant lab with startling results.
The debunker was exposed and fired in discredit.  Another
debunker from Central Florida has recently been exposed and is
now being ignored by serious researchers.

     From Nov. 11 to May 1, 1988 (my last sighting), I have been 
stedfast to the truth as the storm of controversy, both positive
and negative, continued to build in the media.  The most
troublesome question of the controversy is "Why have I had so
many sightings?"  I can not explain the "why" questions, the most
disturbing one being, "Why Me?"

     In an effort to understand, I have undergone a battery of 
pshchological profile tests followed by six hours of regressive
hypnosis.  The details of the hypnosis indicate previous encounters
as far back as 11 years of age.  I was the first to shake my head
in confusion but have come to the adjustment that life goes on--
even life we may not understand.

     Thanks to all those who have stood up and reported what they
saw.  Thank you, Gulf Breeze for being a good neighbor.

GULF BREEZE UFO FROM THE INVESTIGATIVE PERSPECTIVE

                 BY DONALD M. WARE

     During the past year, many residents in and around Gulf Breeze,
FL have been part of a unique experience in this country.  Over 
a hundred people reported objects that we could not identify as
planes, planets, flares, etc..  Some reported seeing alien beings,
and six reported blue beams coming from the UFO.  One respected
Gulf Breeze family had 22 encounters with UFOs, including 18 
separate photographic sessions.  These sessions produced 41 
photographs of at least five different types of flying objects.  Five
different cameras were used providing sufficient data to determine
the size of some objects.  For example, one object photographed 
on 1 May 1988 was 14.8 (misprint?) feet high and had a light on
the bottom that was 14.8 feet in diameter.  I have seen over
60 photos of UFOs from this area.

     Investigations by Newspapers, TV and the Mutual UFO Network
were generally accomplished without ridicule.  This encouraged
12 people to tell of their UFO experiences that involved "missing
time" or extremely strange dreams.  Some of these people are
having trouble coping with their experiences. MUFON established
a support group including abductees, investigators, and a clinical
psychologist to help reduce fear of the unknown.  I think the
support efforts, including time-regression hypnosis, have helped
several who seem to have been inside a UFO understand their
strange experiences.

     I suspect that the increasing national media coverage of the
UFO phenomenon, spurred by the Gulf Breeze photos and sightings
will cause many more abductees to gain the courage to talk about
their experiences.  Perhaps some will seek help in understanding
what happened to them.  I hope investigators and psychologists
across the country will work together to provide this help.

     Some people have been unable to fully accept the reality of
alien visitors, including some "armchair investigators."  Perhaps
the Gulf Breeze photos will help people across the country accept
the reality described in the MJ-12 documents and other government
disclosures.

TO CELEBRATE OR NOT TO CELEBRATE

           BY DUANE COOK

     How do you celebrate the anniversary of an event you are
not yet sure was good?

     Well, maybe celebrate is not the appropriate term.

     Perhaps reminisce is a better word to apply to our thoughts
and activities on this 1st anniversary of the now famous UFO
sightings by "Ed" and others in and around Gulf Breeze.

     Initially we had no idea that printing Ed's photos would cause
such a worldwide interest in our fair community.

     First, there were the wire services that broke the news
worldwide with a brief account of the first sightings.

     Then came the National Enquirer with their offer to pay for
the right to print the photos if NASA Scientists found them
genuine.

     MUFON (Mutual UFO Network) got involved in the investigation
early and became the authority to which the explosion of local
sightings were referred.

     Dr. Bruce Maccabee, an optical physicist under contract with
the Navy, did the most extensive research on the Gulf Breeze 
sightings and photographs and has pronounced theEd lives here and they (the UFOs) just followed
him here to continue their interaction with him as they have done
at eight year intervals since he was a child?

     And what about the many other sightings we've had?  Is it just
coincidence that Charlie and Doris saw the same craft on the same
night that Ed photographed it, thus assuring the Sentinel's
unflinching support while maintaining its unquestioned credibility?

     Then there are the ministers, the teachers, the law enforcement
officers, the district medical examiner and his wife, and even a city
council member.

     Were these people just randomly in the right place at the
right time, or is there an intelligent plan guiding the selection of
who sees it and who doesn't?

     Whether we call it a celebration, a reminiscence, or a review,
we all found it amazing that it's already been a whole year since it 
all started.

     And we wanted to share with you our thoughts and reflections
on this most interesting year.

The following letter from UFO investigator Bob Oechsler appeared
in the May 12, 1988 issue of the Gulf Breeze Sentinel.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

"An Open Letter to the Citizens of Gulf Breeze" 

Dear Gulf Breeze Citizenry:
     For those who don't know me or my contributions to the 
investigation of UFO related activity in Gulf Breeze, I am a UFO
Investigator/Reporter from the Annapolis, Maryland area.  My 
involvement in your local sightings case has been quite extensive
with well over 100 hours of research and telephone interviews 
with investigators, witnesses, photographers, meteorologists, path-
ologists, technologists and the media.  I've been reporting the events
on radio in Baltimore and have included "live" interviews with Ed, 
Duane Cook and others.  I have battled the skeptics and have
reported my findings to the UFO Intelligence Community.  During
this period of time, I have had to investigate numerous sightings of
UFO activity in the Annapolis Bay Bridge area which has served to
limit my otherwise total involvement in the Gulf Breeze Sightings.
     Please be assured that not all "distant experts" are scientifically
critical of the extraordinary events that have been occuring in your
peninsula city.  Before getting too far into this letter, allow me to set
the record straight on one issue of significance to no one by myself.
Mr. R--- S-------  is not a resident of Annapolis, Maryland.  You
remember RS, the author of a report with a Strange Breeze blowing
through his head whose Psychic Premonitions lead him to believe
that The Sightings were all an elaborate hoax.  Mr. RS resides and
receives his mail in College Park, Maryland, some 35 miles from the
quaint little peninsula capitol of the state of Maryland which so 
happens to be the city where I call home.  And so now you see the
reason for my interest in setting the record straight.
     It should be noted that statistically speaking, there are now on
record over 50 sightings of UFO activity in the Gulf Breeze area that
have no connection to the noted photographer Ed.  There are now
on record five photographers of UFO's only one of which has not
been in direct contact with MUFON investigators.  There is now re-
ported to be a second video tape of a moving and hovering UFO;
the photographer is in no way related to Ed.  And, there are over
100 witnesses of sightings who have asked to file reports, with
some accounts involving five and six witnesses.
      Remember the "Jan Tide" with the funny looking blimp of 
radar equipment floating about in Pensacola Bay that was suppose
to leave in late January or early February?  Well you may have
noticed that it is still there over 90 days later. And, in case no one
has noticed, there is now a similar companion vessel out there
with the insignia NASA on the side.  Let's also not forget about that
cute little Army vehicle with the 150-foot telescoping RADAR
globe that had to be moved out of Ft. Pickens due to excessive
curiosity of visitors.  A civilian employee of Pensacola NAS has
reported that there are now 18 of those RADAR vehicles operating
in the Gulf Breeze area.
     What does all of this mean?  We're checking the records, but 
it is doubtful that there has been a significant increase in drug
smuggling activity in the area.  Why has the Network News Media
taken such a hands-off approach to reporting these events outside
of the Pensacola area?  Is there Government INTEREST in this case
of UFO activity?  Is the Government turning some subtle screws to
clamp down on exposing what's really happening here?  If so,
WHY?  The answer may lie somewhere in the MJ-12 documents
that I've enclosed with this letter.  These documents have been 
available for over a year now, and have been widely published in
their entirety in (among others) The Danville Newspapers in 
Pennsylvania and at least one major newsletter out of Cranston,
Rhode Island.  Experts who have researched these documents 
thoroughly say they are authentic.  A memo from President
Truman makes direct reference to the MJ-12 operation.  There
is more, much more, but this should be enough to encourage any
doubters out there that UFO's are REAL.  Their purpose is now 
fundamentally known.  We may be powerless to stop it, although
some experts feel otherwise.
     A letter to the President of the United States was mailed today
along with correspondence to several members of congress and 
the Senate.  The purpose is to seek official help in matters related
to the Gulf Breeze Sightings.  Matters that involve the purpose 
behind the visitations.  Help is very much needed here.  Although
exceptionally competent as I stated in my report to the UFO 
Intelligence Community on April 21, 1988, there are but less than
a handful of part-time qualified investigators available in the 
area to handle the massive workload.  Scientific monitoring and
evaluation by civilian technologists is all but vacant here, except
for the exhaustive efforts of Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D.  The 
reassuring hand of Budd Hopkins has been quite welcome therapy
for those in need, but it is not nearly enough.  
     Will help be on the way?  We'll keep you posted as the gears
and cogs of our bureaucracy oil up for action.  The critics and 
skeptics will not be able to sweep this intrusion under the carpet
with the guise of a hoax for long.  Our prayers are with you and 
all whose lives have been changed forever.
