                      AIR FORCE INFORMATION POLICY LETTER
                               * FOR COMMANDERS

                 FROM OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE

Vol. XIV, No. 12                            Washington, D.C., 15 August 1960

      AIR FORCE MEMBERS MUST KEEP THEMSELVES INFORMED about all kinds of
weapon systems in the U.S. arsenal. In order to fulfill our responsi-
bility to the American people we must understand and be able to explain
the capabilities of the various systems. No weapon system -- even the
newest -- is the complete answer to our defense problems. For this be-
lief to gain currency would be harmful, and this fact has been specifi-
cally recognized by Navy and Air Force leaders. Admiral Burke and
General White have commented in this respect about the Polaris.

      Navy CNO, Adm. Arleigh Burke told a Senate subcommittee on 1961 DOD
appropriations: "We have always contended in the Navy never to rely upon
a single weapon system even a weapon system as good as Polaris, because
that would mean that the enemy could concentrate on the countermeasures
for that single weapon system.... As you know, the Navy's mission is
control of the seas, and now and for the foreseeable future the means
with which to accomplish this mission are surface ships, submarines,
and aircraft. The carrier is simply one of our tools, but the most
important one we have."

      And General White told a House subcommittee; "I am in favor of the
Polaris weapon system. I think that it will contribute significantly to
our overall retaliatory capability; while I would equally stress that it
is not the whole answer by any means.  It is one of several systems which 
promise to be effective and will complicate the enemy's defenses."

                                   * * * * *

      THE 1960 USAF SPEAKERS TEAM, made up of outstanding graduates of the
Air University War College and Command and Staff College, will move into
action after a briefing at Hq USAF this month. Each team member has been
assigned six Air Force installations. A total of 72 installations are
scheduled to be visited -- seven more than last year. Based on 1959
figures, this year's program should involve about 280 presentations be-
fore approximately 100,000 persons. Commanders have been advised of
itineraries.

                                   * * * * *

     NEW "PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE" STUDY provides overseas commanders and their
IOs with assistance in evaluating and planning this vital community rela-
tions activity. It is based on responses of officers and airmen to the
29 February 1960 Trianuual Sample Survey.

     The study gives insight into attitudes and opinions of Air Force
personnel toward the nationals of the country served in; the effective-
ness of overseas orientation; and the contribution of the Armed Forces
Radio and Television Service to command mission accomplishment.

     The study, to be published annually, is classified Confidential. It
will enable commanders and information officers to have a continuous feed
back to evaluate the effectiveness of programs accomplished in the past
years to understand the effect on attitudes of significant events (e.g.
recent rioting in Japan; and to assist in planning future programs
designed to fill specific needs indicated by survey findings.

     Copies of the study are being distributed to commanders and IOs. If
quantity is insufficient at major command level, a limited number are avail-
able directly from SAFOI-5, Department of the Air Force, Wash. 25, D.C.

      AF KEEPING WATCHFUL EYE ON AEROSPACE. Among the Air Force's many
major contributions to the Nation's scientific progress and military
security is its operation of the National Space Surveillance Control Cen-
ter at Laurence G. Hanscom Field, Bedford, Mass.

     The Control Center catalogues for defense surveillance purposes all
artificial satellites launched by this country or other nations. It collects
data on these vehicles, computes their motions, and distributes this infor-
mation to a large number of government, military and scientific agencies.
It provides around-the-clock coverage.

     Dedicated last February, the Control Center is located on the grounds
of the Air Force Command and Control Development Division of Air Research
and Development Command. The Geophysics Research Directorate, working
under the Air Force Cambridge Research Center at Hanscom Field, operated
this tracking activity as "Project Space Track" from November 1957 until
the activity came under the National Space Surveillance Control Center
in 1960.

     Over 100 sensor stations provide data for the Control Center. Stations
include those of U.S. Government agencies, cooperating foreign and domestic
observatories, and various visual observing teams. A control room has a
luminous map of the world upon which selected satellite positions can be
displayed in the form of moving spots of light.

     The Control Center maintains a computer "catalogue" of all space
vehicles in orbit, arranged so the position of all known satellites can
be determined for any particular instant. The catalogue also keeps track
of orbiting booster rockets, rocket shells, or other launch components
accompanying a satellite.

      Sightings are communicated to this catalogue, and the computer auto-
matically compares the reports with data on known space vehicles for
identification. The new information is then used either to improve the
satellite's orbit formula or to establish an equation for the new vehicle.

     There is a relationship between the Air Force's interest in space
surveillance and its continuous surveillance of the atmosphere near Earth
for unidentified flying objects -- "UFO's".  As the Service with the pri-
mary responsibility of providing forces for aerospace defense of the United
States, the Air Force has been, since 1947, studying and analyzing reported
sightings of UFO's, including astronomical objects.

     Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Head of the Department of Astronomy and Director
of the Observatory at Northwestern University, is the Chief Scientific
Consultant to the Air Force on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects.

     A selected scientific group under the supervision of the Air Force,
plus the facilities of the Air Force's Aerospace Technical Intelligence
Center, and the entire facilities of the Nation's scientific and techni-
cal community, as well as the National Space Surveillance Control Center,
keep watch on objects of all kinds in the vast reaches of sky surrounding
our planet.

     QUOTES FOR YOUR SPEECHES. From a report on Soviet espionage prepared
by the FBI in May 196O "Today, the rallying cry of world communism is
'peaceful coexistence.' However, on May 5, 1960, Premier Khrushchev, ad-
dressing the Supreme Soviet in Moscow, paid tribute to V.I. Lenin and
stated 'The Soviet people are proud to know that the cause of our great
leader and teacher live and triumphs and that Lenin's dreams are being
translated into reality by hundreds and millions of people -- builders
of socialism and communism -- and that Lenin's cause is winning all up
right men on earth.' Referring to the triumph of the ideas of Marx,
Engels, and Lenin, Khrushchev went on to reaffirm 'Marxist-Leninist ideas'
as the guide to the ultimate triumph of world communism.

     "Thus, the fact remains that the basic principles of Marxist-Leninist
Philosophy, demanding the use of force and violence, represent the guides
for communism to achieve world conquest. The extensive espionage activities
directed against the United States which, in the past, have utilized Com-
munists and Communist sympathizers in this country as well as other 
individuals who could be subverted can be better understood when regarded
as essential tools in the relentless and fanatical drive of international
communism to conquer the world."

     Related quotable quotes -- J. Stalin as expressed in his Problems of
Leninism:

     "We are living, says Lenin, not merely in a state, but in a system of
states and the existence of the Soviet Republic side by side with imperial-
ist states for a long time is unthinkable. One or the other must triumph
in the end. And before that end supervenes, a series of frightful collisions
between the Soviet Republic and the bourgeois states will be inevitable."

V.I. Lenin:

     "But as soon as we are strong enought to defeat capitalism as a whole,
we shall immediately take it by the scruff of the neck."

Joseph Stalin:

     "Who will conquer who? -- That is the whole question. ...The world
is divided into two camps -- the capitalist camp, headed by Anglo-American
capital, and the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union. The inter-
national situation, therefore, will be more and more determined by the
correspondence of forces between these two camps..."

Nikita S. Khrushchev:

     "Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you!"

     It is clear that when the Communists say "peaceful coexistence" they
actually mean "protracted conflict." (See Co@d War article in 1 February
1960 issue of this letter.)
