=== Miscellaneous Information
-----------------------------
10.00: alt.alien.visitors archives (back issues)
------------------------------------------------
Occasionally I have seen requests for information on past articles in
alt.alien.visitors. If you desire something, I have the entire newsgroup
archive back to July 13, 1992. I access it frequently. I have no way to
ftp it to another system for public access but would be glad to email
portions of it upon request. The responses are not guaranteed to be

10.01: A UFO Book List
-------------------------------
I'd like to take this opportunity to remind people of my UFO bibliography
file, and to solicit contributions and book comments for it.  The file
can be ftp'd from paul.rutgers.edu, directory pub/ufo, file
bibliography.Z (compressed format).  The file is organized by author, and
also again by date-of-publication, and also includes Keith Rowell's
excellent bibliography file (which is also worked into the above two
parts).  Many titles have comments from various people as to the value of
the book; I would like any comments on any of the books from anyone, and
also additional books for inclusion. Check out the UFO Bibliography that
you can ftp at:
  paul.rutgers.edu
  The file is pub/UFO/bibliography.Z It has books by author, a second 
  listing by date, and also the names of prominent authors in the field.

wrote the Earth Chronicles series, Mars probe, Mars Face and many other
topics. The class also offers guest speakers who have done UFO research

NASA Pics Sites
----------------
NOTE: the material at these sites is exceedingly voluminous; 
I'd strongly suggest just getting the CD-ROMs instead of attempting
to transfer scores of gigabytes of pix and other material.

To access the online catalog of NASA material, CD-ROMS, et cetera:

	telnet nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov
	login as "NODIS"
	no password

Anonymous ftp sites (five):

nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov [128.183.10.4]

	This is a VAX/VMS box, so you must ftp-login as "anonymous".  To get
	a dir listing into a file on your system:

	ftp> dir [...] file_on_your_system

vab02.larc.nasa.gov

	lots of stuff, including Aliens of all colors, and UFO pix (though  
this
	seems to mirror a lot of what's at phoenix.oulu.fi and has some
	additional material).

ames.arc.nasa.gov

	online copies of what appears to be all NASA's CD-ROMs, and lots of
	GIFs, *.img and *.jpg from most (all?) space missions since Apollo.

Reporter (IUR)
Founded in 1973 by Dr. J. Allen Hynek

A non-profit organization whose goal is to promote serious research into
the UFO phenomena through the expertise of an international group of
scientists, academians, and volunteers. This organization has a worldwide
network of field investigators that interview witnesses, examine physical
evidence and gather any other relevant information. The major purpose of
CUFOS is to act as a clearinghouse - aplace where UFO experiences can be
reported and researched. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was considered one of
the world's pre- eminent authorities on the UFO phenomenon, first became
involved with UFOs as Scientific Consultant to the U.S. Air Force from 1948
to 1968, and was Scientific Director of CUFOS until his death in 1986. He
coined the phrase "close encounters of the third kind" and acted as
technical advisor to director Steven Spielberg on the movie of the same
name.
CUFOS maintains the world's largest repository of data about UFO phenomena,
second only to the US Government! This
material includes more than 50,000 cases of UFO sightings and a library of
more than 5,000 books and magazines, which cover all aspects of the UFO
phenomena. CUFOS promotes various activities, projects, publications,
symposiums, conferences, seminars and field trips to various UFO-related
locations and sells journals, books, audiocassette tapes, and other
publications. 
The "International UFO Reporter (IUR)", published bi-monthly, reports on
current sightings, news and articles on current UFO topics. CUFOS also
publishes the annual "Journal of UFO Studies" which presents a collection
of scholarly papers on the UFO
phenomenon. A $25.00 contribution entitles a member to become an ASSOCIATE
of CUFOS and to receive the "International UFO Reporter" for one year.
The Center publishes the International UFO Reporter
