                  MARS OBSERVER MISSION STATUS
                       September 10, 1993

     The Mars Observer flight team continued sending commands
today that they had developed earlier this week to test possible
hardware and software problems within the spacecraft's
telecommunications subsystem.   

     A commanding strategy was developed to address specific
areas within the spacecraft.  These command strategies were
considered low risk to the spacecraft and with limited
probability of success.  

     Commanding will be finished later this afternoon.  The
flight team will meet for a command conference early next week to
design and approve the next commanding strategy.

MARS OBSERVER INVESTIGATION BOARD STATUS REPORT 1

	The Mars Observer Investigation board held its first set of meetings
Wednesday through Friday, Sept. 8-10, 1993, in Washington, D.C.

	All aspects of the spacecraft's subsystems were reviewed to better
understand what could have caused the loss of signal from the Mars Observer
spacecraft during the orbital insertion activities initiated on Aug. 21, 1993.

	Chaired by Dr. Timothy Coffey, Director of Research, Naval Research
Laboratory, Washington, D.C., the board heard testimony and reviewed data on
Mars Observer subsystems and mission operations.  Representatives from the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.; Martin Marietta Astro Space, East
Windsor, N.J.; Martin Marietta Denver, Colo.; and Allied Signal Corp., Morris
Township, N.J. provided technical presentations to the board.

	At this stage of the investigation, the board cannot identify any
single aspect of the spacecraft or mission operation as being scrutinized more
than any other.

	The board will develop a systematic approach to determine what caused
the loss of communication and recommend corrective actions to prevent a
recurrence in future missions.  The board will reconvene over the next several
weeks.

	The board intends to submit its findings to the NASA Administrator in
late November. A report will be made public after final acceptance by the
Administrator.
