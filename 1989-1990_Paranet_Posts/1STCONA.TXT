The following is an excerpt from Chapter 9, entitled "First Contact",
from the book, "Visitors From Within", by Keith Priest and Lyssa Royal.
ISBN 0-9631320-1-6. (c)1992.  The questioners comments are indented, and
the answers from the entity, Sasha, are right-justified.

         The other ways that the contact is manifested (through win-
         dows and back doors in the consciousness) seem to be natural
         aspects of who we are. The whole spectrum seems to be natural.
         And yet it is also a spectrum that we've denied.

Yes. It is manifesting itself according to who you are.

         So in a sense it is manifesting according to our denial, not our
         acceptance.

Yes, it can be looked at that way. If you were of an accepting
nature, there would be no need to create blockages nor to break
through various portions of the hose (hose refers to an anology about
a garden hose mentioned earlier). Other civilizations are
different in the ways they manifest first contact. Let us explore two
case studies with you.

These case studies are taken from first-contact mission-team accounts
from our race and others within the Association. The purpose of this
is to demonstrate to you the differences in how societies evolve
themselves toward embracing ET contact.

         ALPHA-3

We will label the first example as Alpha-3. This planetary species was
initially begun by the seeding of Lyran-based groups and left alone to
develop its natural species identity. It was not necessary for this
species to know throughout its evolution that they were seeded by a
source external to their planet. It was not necessary because there
was no longer any interaction with the seeding race. The Alpha-3
society was allowed a very free and natural evolutionary process un-
tainted by any of the galactic dramas.

They naturally progressed through time to a stage of developing
technology. During this time they developed equal balance between
technology and spirituality, so they were expanding at a balanced
rate. One could say that Alpha-3 was a textbook case of planetary
evolution. In that sense it had very little drama and was well
orchestrated. There was a period when this civilization became able to
achieve space travel. Prior to this time they were watched very
closely by some members of neighboring planetary systems. Before
they actually left their planet, they were openly contacted. Let us
describe this further.

         Stage One

There are generally three stages of contact that occur with a species
such as this. The first stage is telepathic contact with inhabitants
of the planet. This is carried out approximately 50-100 years before
the next stage is introduced. Telepathic contact is made with
receptive individuals within the society. The telepathic contact is
not saying, "We are here." It is instead a filtering of ideas about
extraterrestrial beings that seemingly enter the imagination of the
recipient and the normal flow of their life. This is reflected in
society as, for instance, fictional works such as books that
introduce the society to this idea.

         Would this also include archetypal contact through symbol-
         ogy?

Yes. It is on the unseen levels of the humanoid mind.

         Stage Two

Stage two is contact of a physical nature with the inhabitants when
the physical crafts of other civilizations are seen in the skies. This
is not presented in a threatening way. It is usually presented where
there are large gatherings of people so that it becomes very quickly
known.

Often there will also be experiences with these physical crafts. For
example, let us say there is a forest fire that is very difficult to
contain. The ET crafts come by and assist the firefighters to put out
the fire; then they disappear. This is a demonstration of benevolence
and is continued for a span of perhaps 25 years. Then stage three is
initiated.

          Stage Three

Stage three takes advantage of the progress made in stage two. After
one of these instances when the craft had actually assisted with a
disaster, the craft would land and come face to face with some of the
inhabitants of the planet. That is first contact.

Those are the three main stages. The species from Alpha-3 encountered
contact in such a fashion with no resistance or fear. It was simply a
natural expression of evolution on a planetary scale.

         We've had all three stages simultaneoulsly going on throughout
         our history, yes?
