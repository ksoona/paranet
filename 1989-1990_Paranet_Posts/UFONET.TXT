CLASSIFICATION OF OBSERVED UFO OCCUPANTS

by Richard D. Butler




GROUP A...NON-EARTH-BORN HOMO SAPIENS

This group consists of three being types from three distinct colony zones,
namely Sirius, Pleiades and Orion. Genetically, they are nearly identical to
Earth humans with the following exceptions. Abductees refer to these
beings as the "talls." Males average approximately seven feet in height;
females, six and a half feet. They are extremely fine featured, pale in
complexion. Eyes are almond shaped, slightly slanted with a natural black
liner, much like Egyptians. There are three hair colors apparently related to
colony origin: blonde (Pleiades), black (Orion), and red (Sirius). The insignia

of these combined human races is a triangular arrangement of three
spheres. This symbol has deep significance, and is found throughout Earth
history. History records these beings as goddesses, gods, devas, etc. A
subgroup of Group A females is in command of most Earth projects.


GROUP B...EARTH-BORN HUMANS

These are Homo Sapiens whose origin is the planet Earth. They can be
divided into two separate classes.

Class A (Ancient)...These humans were the companions and house
servants of a Group A military mining and occupation force. When this force
left the Earth sometime between 1,000 B.C. and 2,000 B.C., it was decided
to remove all humans that had been in close proximity with them. It was felt
that leaving them would only further disrupt normal human development.
Class A humans are on an equal level with Group A and cooperate fully in
all Earth projects.

Class M (Modern)...These humans are working on the same cooperative
level as Class A. They were taken from the Earth in modern times. During
some abduction projects, twins (either identical or fraternal) are induced in a

female subject. During the first trimester, one of the fetuses is removed. It
is
then grown to maturity by Group A. Abductees will meet their twins during
some abductions. Very limited contact has been made by these humans.


GROUP C...GENETICALLY MODIFIED EARTH-BORN HUMANS

These humans are comprised of two classes and should not be confused
with Group D Greys.

Class W (Workers)...This class is the smallest in physical stature. They are
described as approximately three and a half feet in height, large head and
eyes, pale white in complexion. these workers were created by Group A
through genetic modification of Earth human fetuses. Their function is to
perform menial tasks requiring limited reasoning abilities. In mental
capacity, they are equivalent to a five year old child. They are incapable of
violence and, in come cases, are kept as companions by Group A
individuals.

Class T (Technicians)...These humans are basically the same as Class W.
they are slightly larger, at approximately four and a half feet in height.
Their
complexion is tan or yellowish. Their reasoning and deductive powers are
higher. This allows them to perform more complex operations. They are
often seen operating ship controls and in transport activities. Both Classes
W and T are telepathically camouflaged to appear as Greys by abductees.
This is done to conceal the true nature of Group C. It is felt that perception
of Group A maintaining a human slave population would hinder future
contact efforts. This point will undoubtedly be a source of much heated
debate in the near future.


GROUP D...GREYS

Of the six groups discussed in this paper, the Greys appear to represent the
only non-human contingent. The following data should be considered tentative at

best. Height is approximately five and a half feet. The head is large; eyes
large, black and very slanted. Skin color is dark grey and non-porous. All
data so far indicates that they may be a cetacean-based life form. On Earth,
this comprises the species of whales and dolphins. Descriptions of GreysÕ
skin color and texture closely match that of dolphins. The stare and stun
effects approximate that performed by dolphins on potential enemies, such
as sharks and barracuda.
Human and dolphin fetuses are nearly identical, up to a certain
development stage. Some say they share a common genetic ancestor. If
so, then this makes the hybridization of human and dolphins theoretically
feasible.
There are two possibilities concerning the origin of the Greys. The first is
that a cetacean life form evolved on another planet. Unlike Earth cetaceans,
they did not return to the oceans. The second possibility involves the
genetic modification of Earth cetaceans by Group A. When Group created
workers in ancient times, they may have used the two most evolved species
available. These would have been pre-humans and dolphins. There is
evidence for this in ancient writing, sculptures and paintings. they show a
close relationship between the gods (Group A) and dolphins. In South
America, there are ruins which appear to have been massive water
enclosures. could these have been the breeding pens of the Greys?


GROUP E...HUMAN/GREY HYBRIDS

One of the main ET projects, now in the completion stage, is the hybrid
program. The goal of this project is to produce a being combining the best
physical and mental qualities of both races. The following description is of a
hybrid female, approximately fifteen years old. Height is five feet, three
inches; skin color is pale white/grey. the head is slightly larger and rounder
than normal. Hair is dark, high above the forehead, and worn in a very long
ponytail. The face is very fine-featured, and attractive. Like all the beings
discussed in this paper, her method of communication is telepathic. This
has allowed a deeper understanding of her intellectual and emotional make-
up. They consider themselves human, not Grey, in almost all respects.
They care about the Greys, as any child would a parent, but find them
agonizingly boring. The desire for human contact is greater than all others.
Their capacity for emotion is as great, if not greater than, humans. Any
physical attribute more human than Grey is a great source of pride. their
intellectual capacity is well above human standards.  It is very likely they
will
exceed the capabilities of both races.


GROUP F...SASQUATCH

These have been seen both near, and on-board, UFOs. Little is known
about them. Some have speculated that they are the original pre-human
species from which Homo Sapiens were derived.



"And God said, Let US make man in OUR image, after OUR likeness...."
Genesis, Chapter 1, Verse 26


"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth,
and daughters were born unto them, that the Sons of God saw the
daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which
they chose... There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after
that, when the Sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they
bore children to them...."
Genesis, Chapter 6, Verses 1,2,4

 Here is some BRIEF information that I gathered Saturday,
December 4th, at the 1993 International UFO Congress Convention in
Las Vegas. I wish I could have attended all week, but do to work
schedules I was only able to attend one day. After talking to many
individuals, it seems Saturday was the best day to be there. I will
present this information as non-bias as I can and will not elaborate
on material simply to accomplish adequate writing skills. (besides I
have none)This information will be in an sort-a documented format.
Please enjoy, take it with a grain of salt, (maybe a big grain),
and I sincerely apologize for any mis- -information due to my lack
of note taking skills. All information was coming
pretty fast at me. (here we go..)
(I originally typed this on my Apple and transfered the text to UNIX,
I hope this isn't a problem)

9:00 am Bill Hamilton:
 Bill Hamilton has been involved with the UFO phenomenon
since the early '50s. He was good friends with what he called were
the early contactees. He mentioned names like George Vantassle, and
George Hun Williamson (spelling?). Bill claims to have seen different craft and
have had craft visit him in his earlier days as a youth. He started serious
abduction research in '76 with the Brian Scott
abductee story. He mentioned briefly about some abductees stories,
but started focusing on tie-ins between the military and UFO
technology. He presented information stating that the Airforce was
involved with scientific research in UFO technology in '47, and since
then many scientist around the globe had dabbled with their own
version of a flying saucer. He showed a document which stated a
Townsand Brown (spelling?) developed and anti-gravity device in
'57, and showed pictures of other scientists with (working) models of
hover crafts. Crude as they were they did hover on a blanket on anti-magnetic
energy. Bill claims to have dabbled in that field himself and had
created a working model craft in the late '70's. He claims UFOs generate low
frequency gravity waves but he has his own theory of space flight. His theory
is based on the Lorentz (spelling?) theory but the explanation is different.
His theory is based on, Space is generated by a fluid ether, a super fluid as
he called it. (he touched briefly about his techniques, and I suggest anyone
interested in it, contact him throughthe UFO Congress) He then said he
personally has designed another working model and if all goes well, will show
it working at his next appearance first of '94.
 Bill said his first interest about Groom lake was in '67 when he
read one of the first stories of saucer sightings at Area 51. The story
claimed the '47 Corona crash vehicle was located there. Since then his research
has focused around that information. He mentioned at an earlier visit this
year at Groom Lake, highway 375, mile marker 26 he saw a strange phenomenon.
Him and his (wife?) went to Groom lake on a hunch from some
information he gathered. At this mile marker
26, he saw strange lights off on the distance and stopped his vehicle.
They watched what they thought were headlights of a military
vehicle off in the distance come toward them (thinking they were
going to get hassled) the lights started to hover and shoot towards
him. He grabbed for his camera and at that time his companion
claimed the lights started rotating then flashing multi-colored. By the
time he had his camera, the lights had move down the road they
were on and in front of them. He took a picture of what he called,
two of the brightest lights he ever-seen coming down the road at
him. By the time the camera had reset for another picture, the
vehicle low to the ground passed them like a comet. He showed the
picture, and it looked like two very bright headlights. He and his
companion, then experienced that there was a lapse of 24 minutes
because his companion was keeping a very strict log. The loss of time
was confirmed by the thier digital watches and the clock in his
vehicle. Under hypnosis he talks about being taken on board that
craft and put on a slanted observation table. He also claimed the
experience left him having a very pleasant experience. (I don't recall
what happened to his companion.)
 (FYI) Bill also mentioned out here in California, in the Techacapi
mountains, Northrop has an underground skunk-works facility and is
experimenting with hover craft. He showed a video of an oval shaped light
hovering off the ground for less than an hour. While taping this, another
light
dropped from a high altitude on its left and shot down to the ground.
(sort-a like a tumbling effect) (The video was clear and not
distorted.) He also mentioned that Lockheed, and Douglas, have great
interest in that area. He also showed magnified pictures of test
devices that came out of the ground through hatches they were
experimenting with.

11:06 Dr. Greer; Emergency trauma MD and founder of CSETI.
 Dr. Steven Greer is currently working with openly diplomatic
means of contacting ETs. He claims the trend for global contact is
increasing daily. He is part of the RMIT team which is sent around
the world trying to establish a structural contact technique. He says
that ETs have been very interested in our civilization since the
experimentation with atomic energy and due to current
global situations, now is the time to release information and bring it
out in the open.
 Dr. Greer talked about a five day trip in Mexico that
accomplished a close encounter of the 5th kind, human initiated
contact. He and his team had drove then hiked about 12 miles to a
secluded location where sightings were frequent. Using combined
mental energy, were able to bring down a large triangular craft
about the size of three football fields. Using lights, they were trying
to communicate landing procedures. They initiated multiple contacts
with the crafts while they were there, but none actually landed. No
pictures were taken, due to a strong energy interference that shut
down all equipment, but his group also believes that at this time in
the communication process with ETs, that photo opportunities should
not be arranged. Their first rule of their organization is to be
accepted by the ETs as concerned individuals for universal affairs
and not as individuals wanting materialistic pleasure for something
of this great importance. Actual evidence will be plentiful once the
ET's have accepted us. (for detailed information about the 5 day trip,
contact the CSETI organization.) Dr. Greer also talked about multiple
sightings in the Gulf Breeze region which involved these same type
triangular space craft.
 Dr. Greer then lectured on what needs to be done and what is
being done to initiate the US to disclose information publicly on UFO
evidence. He states that
within 10/12 months the Govt. will release actual evidence of the
UFO phenomenon and is very positive that this will happen. He is
involved with compiling the needed information to convince the
government, "now is the time to come clean". He asked all of us there
not to pressure the military about this as they react to pressure by
implying fear tactics, and this could back-fire. He said that we need
to help those responsible for with-holding information from us to
accept that this subject will not go-away and that we are very willing
to help them disclose what they know in various structured formats. He
also mentioned that the Japanese government is currently compiling
what they have on this subject and is getting ready to release that
information publicly. This might be a good time to send a message to
our new administration that we should be second to none when
releasing such important information like this to the world.
note: Dr. Greer says there could be a correlation between seismic
activities and sightings.

1:45 George Wingfield (Great Britain) Expert in the field of Crop Circle
Phenomena.
 George spent most of his time showing crop circle formation
slides. He talked about which formations were fake and which ones
he considered valid.
I didn't write down the names and dates of the valid formations as
opposed to
the fake ones but did get information on how to acquire this. (I'll
enclose the information at the end of this segment) He told basically
how he validated the
crop formations.
The fake formations:
1. Foot prints were found.
2. Living organisms destroyed.
3. The crop was broken and mutilated.
4. The formation of the crop was not uniformed.
5. The texture of the formation of the crop was not uniformed.

The valid formations:
1. No footprints
2. Seed anomalies.
3. Expansion of plant cell wall pits.
4. Carbon blackening.
5. Anomalies in swelling of the plant nodes.
6. The crop was not damaged would recover.
7. Only two cases of mammal or insect death.
 a. An insect was found dead at one formation.
 b. Porcupines have been found dead at formations in Canada.
 (Porcupines have a tendency to roll up in a ball when
        frightened, where most creatures, run-a-way.)

note: Some crop formations resembled each other in a SPECULATED
design of , earth, wind, fire, water, and in the center consciousness.
(like the five formation on a domino, with the circle in the center
being the largest to signify consciousness.)

 George did speak of a particular formation that appeared at a
test site. A site was selected due to multiple UFO sightings in that area.
Test equipment was set-up, cameras, and detection devices. Intruder alert
devices were set-up around the perimeter to catch possible hoaxters.
During the period of nights they were there nothing extraordinary
happened. Towards the end of their experiment, late in the evening
(or very early in the morning) a thick mist covered the field they
were watching. Thinking it was pointless to stay there not
being able to catch anything on film, they were going to leave but
decided to stay in-case the fog lifted. At day break when the fog
started to lift they noticeda formation had occurred during the night. All
of their instruments were running and nothing had triggered the intruder
alarms. Upon close examination of the formation, it was declared valid.
George seems to think that these formations could be accomplished from high
altitudes. Witnesses have claimed they have seem formations being created in
front of them while seeing nothing structural around it. Some witnesses have
seen large balls and some cases small ball of light around the crop before the
formation was created. Psychics and many individuals claim to be able to sense
energy within the circles while others claim they contracted illnesses from
being too close. One note though, usually where there was multiple
sightings of UFO's, crop formations occurred. I had an opportunity to
ask him a couple of questions, so I will share them with you-all.

1. Is there a resemblance between Hopi Indian symbols and certain
crop formations?
(answer) Yes, we are working with experts in the field of Hopi Indian
culture to determine if they are related.

2. Have you considered that maybe these valid formations are
directed for someone else?
(answer) Definite possibility that these formations could be for other
than life as we know it.

3:35 Michael Lindeman: UFO researcher and futurist of the 20/20
Group.
 Michael started his lecture claiming he had never had contact,
never seen a UFO, and never believed in UFOs, till about 6 years ago.
He then said he envied anyone who had. He initially started research
on a UFO story expecting to be done with it within a week, and found
there was more than just that particular story he was researching.
Determined, he change his life around and started to concentrate on
researching UFO phenomenons. Michael went into his lecture stating:

1. UFO abductees, sighters, are not crazy! Determined by a study out
of Canada.(went into the Canandian study)
He said you can relax now, we know your not crazy.
2. Real UFOs exist! He talked about project Blue Book and the fact the
Airforce had 701 cases they could not explain and could not get rid of.
3. Aliens are real! If they weren't then why would congress allocate
over 100 million into the SETI project. (by the way the SETI project
has enough privately funded dollars to keep operational till the
middle of next year.) He talked about what the Government has done to
satisfy the public while holding the truth.
4. If UFOs are real then how could the government keep the secret so
well? Well..
SECRETS CAN BE HELD! He mentioned the JFK case, and the fact that
real secrecy plays by NO RULES. He talked about atomic bomb
research in the early '40s. Roosevelt knew about it but when Truman
came into office he had to be briefed, the Vice President was un-
aware of the atomic research that was going on. He talked about how
the development of the A-Bomb initiated and structured the patterns
for secrecy and black budgets in America. It was easy to hide the
Roswell incident following the procedures previously learned. He
mentioned that the A12 was designed in '62 for the CIA by
Lockheed, and was totally secret from top officials in the Airforce,
until they received their version the SR71 in '64. Of-course Congress
didn't know about the SR71 till '68. He mention other secrets that
were successfully held that we know about now, and claim that it's
not that hard for a government to keep a secret.
5. The alien presence is known to elite and secretive groups within
the US. government, as well as other major governments. For a
variety of reason, those who know of it decided decades ago that
public revelation of the alien presence posed an unacceptable risk to
social order. Thus the truth has been hidden. He said it's hard to do
scientific research with scientists who understand and know, but lie.
 Michael, like Dr. Greer believes that the time is here to release
this information to the public. He believes the military and
government leaders are more scared about ET technology than the
public could be. This is the first time
in the history of this earth that a government and/or military does
not have complete or any control of a situation. They never did. They
thought they could, but previous (accidents?) proved otherwise.
Beings of other nature hold all the cards. And on top of that when all
the information is released, then comes the rivers of lies, and deceit.
Michael also mentioned that religion is in big trouble, and certain
religious leaders will be left speechless. General beliefs may not be
altered, but the very structure itself will have to be re-thought.

Summary: The day went very fast, a plethora of information was
blasted at me, and again I apologize if some information is
inconsistent with information readers may have. I tried to write as
close to my notes and as non-biased as possible. While talking with
individuals, I learned that an Area 51 visit was made the previous
Tuesday. The two men I was talking with claimed they did see
something off in the distance that resembled a hovering light with no
characteristics resembling helicopters. They were still excited.
Anyway all my comments for clarification were in parentheses.
Please no flames, comments are welcome. I suggest flamers call or
write the International UFO Congress World Headquarters to
subscribe to the tapes of the proceedings to answer thier flames.

SUBJECT: R.A.F. Base - BRAWDY, West Wales.

Note: Some of this article is based on my speculation which I cannot myself
prove, but put forward for investigation.

In the Book "THE WELSH TRIANGLE" by Peter Pagent, talk is made of the Royal
Air Force base at Brawdy in West Wales. He makes obseravtions of UFO's
hovering/landing without authorisation in or near the base and entering or
hovering about the sea nearby.

 The Author states that his sources state that and his own belief is that
the Oceanographic Base owned by *AMERICANS* at Brawdy was infact a little
more involved than it's description. He speculated that there were arrays
of wires that led from Brawdy down to the Sea.

He believed that the UFO's were interested in the purpose of the Base for
the same reasons as he was... What was going on and what were these wires
going down to the sea?

Speculation was also that the Base had a Nulclear involvement in the
capactity of hydrophonic sounding or listeneing out into the Atlantic.  Due
to the secrecy suurounding the bases activities it was not possible to
confirm any of this at the time of writing the book.
*****

This book was written some time ago, but I have kept an eye on the
activities of this base in as much as he authorities have always played it
down.

Bawdy used to be a training centre for Jet Aircraft, Although is easily
accessable by road, and viewable from Roads which run close to the base   -
secrecy still surrounds some of the things going on inside. (Such is the
military eh? Also I have driven past the  base once)

I was suspicious by the way a couple of years ago that the Ministry of
Defence announced that Brady was going to be closed! My eyes opened when I
heard of this, partly because of what Pagent said in his book. (You will
have to read the book!)  My instinct was to not listen to this "shutting"
or "scaling down stuff" ,instead I told a freind of mine who had an
interest in the base like myself because of the previous UFO history. I bet
my freind, that the base would not close and infact if there was an
American interest inside which was not going to leave (which was still
secret) then it was probably a play down attempt.

I wanted very much to take a trip up this summer just to see what was going
on, and if there was some sort of reason for playing the base down... I
didn't get round to it unfourtunately (I wouldnt make a very good UFO
investigator) but my gut feeling was that there may have been reason to
visit now especially.                              ........... UP TO DATE:
Yesterday on the 6th December 1993 on H.T.V (TV channel for Wales) in the
news at 6.00PM there was a report about Brawdy.  A Whale expert was needing
recordings of Whalesong etc for his studies. Somehow either he got in touch
with the Americans at Brawdy or, I think they actualy got in touch with
HIM!!! The Americans supplied him with as much Whalesong as he could
handle, also aditional data about the whales movement patterns. He was over
the moon!

 Explination of where they got the material... Remote listening devices off
the coast from Brawdy!!!

***I couldn't believe it. It gets better though!***

The reporter spoke to the Whale researcher who explained that in contacts
he had made with Brawdy officals he had learned that the Sea Devices had
been there for quite some time, since 1960 something I think was said! The
Brawdy site was unique and ideal for such devices due to its open view out
onto the atlantic. He was told by officals that listening for nuclear
submarines or other vessels was the purpose, and that they could be tracked
well out into the middle of the atlantic!!!!!! (wow!) Also the Americans
who operated the equipment were in thier spare time using the equipment to
follow the activities and locations of Whales out in this area, and on one
occasion they used the gear to pick up sounds emminating from the Whale and
were able to track it for 40 days by which time it had travelled to
BERMUDA!

****This gear must be space-age-plus technology to be able to do this!****

 Here is the clincher. The reporter then tried on many seperate occasions
on many different levels to gain access to the base to talk to the
engineers or officials about the interesting Whale stuff and perhaps see
some of the equipment used. They didn't want to know him. Repeated attempts
at even very low key discussions on the matter were refused. This did
puzzle the reporter, but not to a great degree. (He wasn't seeing the full
picture, even from the point of view of the submarine listening statiion
point of view!)

(Note: I cannot remeber if the reasearcher got access to the base. I think
he did not. He was given the tapes and data by some other means.)

Why not talk to the reporter? The secret (if it was really a big one
anyhow?) was out!  After all they had released the tapes to the researcher,
along with other data. Why not speak to the reporter?

I think they weren't sure what exactly the reporter was after and did not
want to allow any access until the situation had been asessed. Perhaps this
release of the Whalesong tapes was not sanctioned by the higher ranking
officials??? Perhaps there is even more going on that they don't want
disclosed!

(remember me saying about my Play Down theory... Well this story would mean
media attention. If this is the case, somebody is probably in a lot  of
trouble?)

                        epilogue.....

Very strange though isn't it. Equipment like that since the 1960's... Peter
Pagent wasn't far wrong was he?

This is my point- Peter Pagent was very close to the truth. It is a shame
that until things come out officialy, the public won't accept them. Many
UFO stories, reports and informers get so much hassle when they could be
telling the facts straight!

Still now, no member of the public has seen what goes on at the American
"Ocean Reasearch!" (snigger!) facility as far as I am aware.

Just another example of how it all comes out in the end...

(could the base also be interested in tracking UFO's underwater? BERMUDA
remember... BERMUDA... since the 1960's!!! 1960's!!! ) Comments please.

I will be forwarding this to BUFORA on the NET due to it's British slant.

    We stand accused, according to the various rumors that are
circulating, of being key figures in one of the greatest
conspiracies ever to hit the paranormal field.
   Well, golly... shucks, folks....
   Actually, we wouldn't mind taking the credit, but out of a
sense of sheer honesty and modesty we have to report that we are
a bit short of realizing this conspiratorial goal.  Nonetheless,
if others want to continue this conspiracy, then we should not be
too modest or too honest, but do what we can to keep those rumor
mills grinding.
   First, though, a little background for those of you who are
joining us late.  Rumor has it that we are working for the CIA,
and specifically the Aviary, to spread disinformation throughout
the crop circle-ufology fields.  Lately, we have been named as
part of an alleged international disinformation conspiracy in
"Schnabelgate," the Jim Schnabel-Robert Irving-George Wingfield-
Henry Azadehdel tape circus that hit crop circles last fall.
    Wingfield, one of England's leading cereologists, suspected
Irving and Schnabel of hoaxing circles in order to discredit the
phenomenon and its researchers.  He enlisted the help of Henry
Azadehdel, a.k.a. Armen Victorian, a journalist who specializes
in writing exposes in the UFO field.  Posing as an African
journalist, Azadehdel called first Irving and then Schnabel to
ask questions about the "conspiracy."  Irving and Schnabel say
they knew what game was afoot, and put one over on Azadehdel by
embroidering a tall story of a conspiracy involving intelligence
agencies in the US, UK and Germany, and the Vatican as well.  The
conversations were taped, and Wingfield took them as gospel
truth.  The resulting controversy has damaged cereology and
alienated researchers.
    Now Wingfield comes along to stir the pot even more, talking
about a CIA lunch we three were at last year, showing in his
lectures a slide of Rosemary seated next to a member of the
Aviary.  The implication is that this was the Big Approach to
Compromise George.  Sorry, George, it ain't so, and more about
"The Lunch" in a moment.
    We've been publicly silent about all these allegations,
because denial only fuels more intense belief on the part of the
paranoid.  Those who love rumors will continue to believe in them
and spread them, regardless of what we say.  We'd rather stay out
of the rumor gutter and talk to people who are interested in the
truth.  We've been asked what we're really doing.  Here's our
answer.
      In the beginning there was eschatology--the branch of
theology dealing with the end times.  Dan, having spent many
years first studying physics and then metaphysics, came to the
conclusion that the scientists have been looking at the world
upside down.  Mind, not matter, is the foundation for all
realities.  Moreover, the materialist paradigm was in danger of
imminent collapse, being subverted on the inside by its own
contradictions, and on the outside by the growing body of
evidence for the paranormal.

    Creating and maintaining a reality is no easy game.  It
requires a lot of magic, and a lot of conscious critters like
ourselves who are pretty good at collective self-deception.
Fortunately--or perhaps unfortunately--our particular reality
game has about reached its natural conclusion, and we are waking
up to the fact that mind and matter are not separate.  We are
undergoing an exciting but stressful revolution in our collective
consciousness.
    This revolution, or global spiritual emergency, will bring
upheavals and overloads in our global consciousness that will
impact the material Earth for better or worse, and may quickly
get out of control.  We also will be opening up to other
realities that will be impacting us as well.
    Our present very tidy sense of reality and its boundaries is
due to become much more fluid and permeable.  Every spiritual
tradition takes very seriously its prophesies about the end of
the world, but for the first time we are seeing these prophesies
turning into believable predictions of earth and reality changes.
    That is how Dan fell from physics into eschatology.
After experiencing numerous slammed doors among his former
scientific colleagues, he decided that the most logical place to
find fellow eschatologists would be in various intelligence
agencies and among investigators of the paranormal.
    Dan next addressed how to communicate about the eschaton.
Even a small hint that the government is worried about the end of
the world might start a chain reaction of panic, which could
possibly serve as a trigger for the eschaton.  On the other hand,
people inside the government might be wanting to set up a kind of
civil defense network vis a vis the eschaton, and so they would
be looking for people on the outside who could much more freely
network among the general public.
    An important link in the communication chain is what has
become known as the Aviary.  This is the final link next to the
public network, and so it must be heavily disguised by its own
surrealistic smoke screen.  The Aviary functions best by
amplifying people's own misconceptions about the paranormal.  It
does this by helping to overinflate individual pieces of the
puzzle so that particular investigators get pushed further into
their own blind alleys.  People are encouraged to be so
distracted by the trees that they fail to see the forest.
    This cacophony by people looking for truth in all the
strangest places provides an excellent cover for the deadly
serious business of clearing the decks and battening down the
hatches for the eschaton event.  It is like a Manhattan Project
going on behind the scenes of alien grays and praying mantises
having sex with humans.  However, this eschaton conspiracy is
being orchestrated by higher powers, and we don't mean the
Committee of 300.  Very few of the people even near the center of
the orchestration have a clear picture of what is coming down,
but they do know that something is coming and that they will have
front row seats.
    The Manhattan Project relative to the eschaton is a global
civilian network of people who will serve as a lightning rod for
the cosmic energies coming in during the consciousness
revolution.  They will be looking to channel these energies
into expanded realities.  Thus, they will provide a degree of
protection for those people who can find their places alongside
the network.  Outside of the network there will be greater levels
of trauma and confusion.
    The pieces of the network are already in place, the
remaining task is to properly activate and link the pieces
into a critical mass of awareness.  This last step is now
underway.  This is how an Aviary helps to spawn an Aquarium,
and how birds learn to swim.  The Aquarium is our business, and
we are working to reach people who are ready to be activated in
the consciousness revolution.
    Now about the CIA lunch with George Wingfield.  It was
organized by Dan as a networking effort, and took place on April
15, 1992 in a restaurant in Arlington, Virginia.  Besides
ourselves and George, participants included George's wife,
Gloria, three employees of the CIA and an outside colleague of
theirs.  None of us knew in advance what would be discussed.
Conversation centered on eschatology, crop circles, and an
explanation of the Aviary given to George by "The Pelican."
There were no requests, no offers.
    Afterward, George wondered what it was all about.  The
answers are obvious, but they won't be found in rumors.

Editor's Note:
I was intrigued after reading the "Aquarium Memo"  because it, in
essence, raised more questions than it answered--especially on the
eschatology issue. I drafted a response and uploaded it to Don Allen,
(moderator for the FIDO UFO conference) requesting that he forward it
to Dan Smith and Rosemary Ellen Guiley.  Several days later, I received
a call from Mr. Smith. I must confess that, being at work, I was
unprepared for the interview that followed.

Surprisingly, he confirmed the existence of the "Aviary," the shadowy
UFO intelligence group that includes the infamous "Falcon" and "Condor."
Smith also indicated that Richard Doty was still an active member of
the "Aviary," although his primary contact with this group is "Pelican."
Pelican's principle duty is to track millennial/eschatological communities,
"entering a twilight zone where psychic techniques are being generated by
humans and other entities."

Mr. Smith recounted the October 28, 1992 event in South Korea where
religious devotees of a particular sect awaited the "end of the world."
Over 20,000 members of the South Korean armed forces deserted during
this event and U.S. Army psychiatrists were sent to deprogram and
debrief them.

According to Mr. Smith, UFOs are primarily a psychological/metaphysical
phenomenon which are both preparing us and pressuring us to develop our
own psi abilities. Not that UFOs are a single type of entity, Smith
asserts that there are "powers and principalities" at work--presumably
angels and demons.

Furthermore, a radical program of psychic research and development is
currently underway near Los Alamos, New Mexico. This group's development
of psychokinesis, parapsychology, and psychotronics (a term used to
denote psychic warfare techniques) represents a danger of  eschatological
proportions. "These techniques have been available, but controlled,
throughout history. Now, other entities are forcing the issue," says Smith.

The "Aquarium," as outlined by Smith and Guiley, is devoted to assisting
the "Aviary" in establishing a network of "spiritually advanced"
individuals to lessen the impact of the eschaton event.

During the course of our conversation, Mr. Smith seemed unable to
provide proof for his claims. He did report that his government sources
"hinted at" an eschatological emergency. To prove the evil intent of the
entities involved, he referred to reports of human mutilations in the
Amazon which have been officially attributed to drug dealers, but according
to his sources, were committed by these evil entities.

In closing, I passed along Armen Victorian's question (see Letters section)
concerning Rosemary Guiley's association with Vance Tiede and "RADM"
(Rear Admiral?) Harold Bliss and their "involvement in the UFO affairs."
Smith responded that it was Vance Tiede who originally suggested to Ms.
Guiley that she get involved in circles research and facilitated her
contacts in this field.

So what does it all mean? Mr. Smith revealed that  the eschatological issues
raised related directly to the Biblical prophecies in the book of
Revelations. On the surface it could be that we're experiencing millennial
fever at the close of the 20th century. Then again, there are many
reports of secret military psi programs such as reported in Howard
Blum's Out There and the accounts of Ed Dame's commercial remote viewing
enterprise, PSITECH.

Mr. Smith has been invited to write an article for HUFON Report that
will articulate, in detail, his views and why he holds them.
