Scientist Blows Lid Off NASA Cover Up!

TOP SECRET PHOTO PROVES HUMANS LIVED ON MARS!

A secret NASA photograph proves it beyond the shadow of a doubt: The
mysterious Stone Face on Mars was built by human beings who lived on the
Red Planet 200,000 years ago and later colonized Earth!

	That's the word from astrophysicist Benjamin Frania, who obtained a
copy of the photograph from NASA sources after the agency's Mars Observer
space probe beamed it back to Earth on August 20.  Nobody in authority is
willing to talk about the photo at this early date.  But Dr. Frania has
learned that NASA analysts have privately concluded "that far from being a
natural formation as we once suspected, the stone face was almost certainly
sculpted by human hands."

	NASA's offical report, which has been classified "Eyes Only" by
NASA brass, goes on to say that "in all likelihood, the stone face was
built by our own human ancestors - people who evolved and created a
civilization on Mars before something happened to their environment,
forcing colonists to migrate to Earth.  Needless to say, this information
is not for public consumption.  Society is not equipped to handle the
notion of our extraterrestrial ancestry at this time."

	"This is it - this is the proof we've been waiting for," Dr.
Frania, who is widely considered to be one of the world's leading space
scientists, told reporters in Washington, D.C.

	"The stone monument has been a mystery ever since NASA's Viking
probes send back the first fuzzy photographs in the 1970s," he continued,
"but now that we have this new photograph, the mystery is solved."

	"Anyone with eyes to see can appreciate the talent skill and
thinking that went into the construction of this one-mile long, 2,000 foot
high stone monument."

	"And it doesn't take a NASA analysts to figure out that it was
build with human hands."

	"The powers that be can try to keep this secret all they want. But
the word is out - and I personally challenge NASA to provide us with the
full and immediate disclosure mankind deserves."

	NASA will neither confirm nor deny the report.  But spokesmen did
call into uestion his claim that the photograph was taken on Auust 20
"because the Mars Observer didn't achieve orbit around the planet until
Auust 24."

	Undaunted, Dr. Frania quoted highly placed NASA insiders as having
said that to contrary to published reports, the probe that was launched
last September 25 "has actually been orbitin and photographin the surface
of Mars since August 18."

	"This is more than a cover-up, this is a conspiracy to keep
Americans, and all mankind for that matter, in the dark," said Dr. Frania.

	"I understand NASA's fear that a revelation like this could cause
world panic. But people have a right to know where they came from and who
their real ancestors are."

	"The fact that this stone face was modeled after a human being and
is estimated to be at least 200,000 years old proves that an extremely
advanced human civilization existed on Mars before mankind even appeared on
Earth."

	"Estimates vary, but most scholars agree that humans first appeared
on Earth between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago - which sugests that those
first humans came to Earth from Mars"

	What led NASA analysts to conclude that our ancestors inhabited
Mars in the distant past remains a mystery at this point.

	But Dr. Frania has heard that the Mars Observer also photographed
an enormous, Stonehenge-like map of the solar system on the planet's
surface.  It is rumored that the map shows a line between Mars and Earth
with something that looks like a saucer-shaped starship in between
	"NASA's own experts have speculated that a global environmental
disaster destroyed the Martian atmosphere, slowly making it uninhabitable,"
said Dr. Frania.

	"That would certainly give the humans who lived there a strong
incentive to colonize another life-sustaining planet.  In this case, that
planet was Earth."
