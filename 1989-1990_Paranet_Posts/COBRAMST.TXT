                               INTRODUCTION

The controversial "Bentwaters Case" (1980) has long been of interest; 
especially so because the "Halt Memo" documents the anomalous events to some 
degree. These events have been the subject of Radio and television programs, 
magazine and newspaper articles, books, and much research, discussion and 
speculation. 

It was with interest that we read _Out of the Blue_, by Jenny Randles, 
(Global Communications, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 1991.) We found it 
interesting that located in the vicinity of the infamous Orford Ness 
lighthouse, (which some say is what was seen in Rendlesham Forest those 
December nights in 1980), is an apparently secret research installation. One 
of the projects mentioned by Ms. Randles sited at Orford Ness, is "Cobra 
Mist", "officially an advanced "over the horizon" radar..." [1] 

We filed Freedom of Information Act requests for information on Cobra Mist 
with several U.S. agencies, and after some delay received some heavily 
censored documents and one large complete document. The one large item is an 
article from a classified research journal, the "JDR" (Journal of Defense 
Research?). The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was the 
declassification authority for this document. Judging by the MAR 23, 1993 
declassification date, we may very well be the first to obtain this 
information. The "automatic" declassification downgrade date is given as Dec. 
31, 1991, but apparently the document had not been reviewed until our 
request. The documents received and attendent FOIA reply letters are 
reproduced in this file. 

Indeed, from the released documents, COBRA MIST was an OTH radar operated 
from the late 1960's until June 30, 1973; a costly but apparently 
ineffective system. Confirming the 'understanding of the locals' as Ms. 
Randles reports, the COBRA MIST radar was "connected with nuclear missile 
test launches" [2] as part of the stated mission was to oversee Soviet and 
Soviet Bloc Countries' aircraft and missile operations. However, no 
connection whatever to any operations similar to "Star Wars" is revealed by 
the released documents. [3] 

Whether or not COBRA MIST is connected with the "fireball" and other 
unusual phenomena Ms. Randles reports as occurring in the vicinity of Orford 
Ness is not revealed by the released documents. However "antenna arcing" and 
"corona" are mentioned. Both of these are electrical effects which occur at 
high power levels and reveal the strength of the electrical fields 
surrounding the radar antenna which itself was physically massive. As a 
speculation, we suppose it is remotely possible that SOME sightings or other 
effects MIGHT be attributed to the intense radio frequency electrical field 
present when the radar was being operated at high power levels. Note that 
the design power level of the radar was never realized. 

For those interested in obtaining further information about COBRA MIST, the 
documents contain many references which may be obtainable. There are also 
references to other OTH radar systems. 

Some notes: Some changes were necessary to accurately reproduce the documents 
in pure ASCII. Namely, figures and photographs have been omitted for obvious 
reasons, although the captiona and security markings have been retained. 
Other letters have been substituted for Greek letters used in formulae and 
the various fonts and type sizes are not represented, although pagination, 
indentation and general appearance are retained.

441A
         System 441A, known as COBRA MIST, was initiated to acquire,
install, and test the AN/FPS-95 OTH Radar Set in an operational over-
seas environment at Orfordness, England, (See ESD History for FY 1972,
p. 172 ff.).
         System turnover was scheduled for 1 July 1972. However, due to
several test delays the turnover was rescheduled for 1 January 1973. In
the interim, it was decided to combine the Design Verification System
Test (DVST) and Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (IOT&E) in order
to expedite the test program.
          In the combined DVST and IOT&E during the summer and fall
of 1972, a severe noise problem was encountered, which resulted in a
reduction in detection Capability. The range related noise had a me-
dian value of -65 decibels; in addition, there were noise modulation
sidebands 10 to 30 hertz from the carrier with a median value of -60
decibels.

 =========================================================================

      In January 1973, a joint United States/United Kingdom (US/UK)
Scientific Assessment Committee (SAC) was formed to analyze the prob-
lem.   The committee was comprised of:

 Dr. M. Balser                     Xonics Corporation            Chairman
 Prof. E. D. R. Shearman, V. C.    Birmingham University         Member
 Dr. J. Aarons                     Air Force Cambridge           Member
                                   Research Labs
 Dr. E. N. Bromley                 Radio & Space Research        Member
                                   Station
 Dr. C. M. Crain                   Rand Corporation              Member
 Dr. T. Croft                      Stanford University           Member
 F. A. Kingsley                    UK Ministry of Defense        Member
 Dr. B. Roberts                    Royal Radar Establishment     Member
 Wing Commander D. R. J. Evans     Royal Air Force, Orfordness   Secretary

          The purpose of the SAC was to:

     1.   Investigate the fundamental causes of the degradation
          in performance in the COBRA MIST OTH RADAR.

     2.   Recommend measures to overcome system deficiencies.

     3.   Assess the potential radar performance.

           The SAC met during the period February-May 1973. In May, the
committee issued a final report which contained 10 recommendations, with
the following four listed as high priority:

     1.  Implement a more flexible and effective set of pro-
         cessing and display programs and procedures.

     2.  Develop and install a pulse compression system with
         a pulse length of the order of 100 microseconds.

     3.  Further study, both experimentally and theoretically,
         the characteristics of excess noise, with the aim of
         minimizing its effect on radar operations.

     4.  Provide for strong technical management to carry out
         the proposed program which must include further tech-

 =========================================================================

         nique developments in addition to evaluating opera-
         tional effectiveness.

          The SAC said that given the proposed system modifications
and Studies, the system would undoubtedly be greatly enhanced in per-
formance and potential. The committee added that following the modifi-
cations, the system should undergo a series of operational feasibility
tests for one year, the results to be the basis for any future decisions
on COBRA MIST.
          The findings, results, and recommendations of the committee
were briefed to the U.S. Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) and the
United Kingdom Ministry of Defense (UK/MOD) in May 1973. The result
of these briefings was a joint US/UK decision, based on an economic
analysis of the requirements, to terminate operations at Orfordness. 17
     The decision was publicly announced in London by the Ministry of
Defense on 29 Jun 1973.

441A 

                       441A, known as COBRA MIST, is a program to ac-
quire, install, and test the AN/FPS-95 OTH Radar Set in an operational 
overseas environment. The 441A contractor is RCA; the 441A site is
Orfordness, England.
                       The missions of the 441A AN/FPS-95, an over-the-
horizon (OTH) backscatter radar, are to detect and track aircraft;
detect missile and earth satellite vehicle launchings; fulfill cur-
rent and critical intelligence requirements; and to provide a re-
search and development (R&D) testbed for determining optimum back-
scatter techniques for other operational missions.
     By 10 July 1971 the 18th (and last) antenna string was installed.
phasing at high power began on 17 July.
     The Rome Air Development Center (RADC) aircraft conducted anten-
na pattern measurement tests 5-17 August, with the radar operating
10 decibels down. All 18 strings were tested at all ranges, includ-
ing the side lobes and back lobes. The aircraft long range tests
were completed early in September 1971.
     The upper catenary nuplaglass rod between mast #38 and string
#18 failed on 23 September, and the resultant shock wave caused
most of mast 38 and most of mast 39 to crack off at the 120-foot
level.  The initial assessment indicated the failed rod had pre-
viously been rejected by RCA because of a deep transverse cut, and

 =========================================================================

the unit should not have been installed. String 18 was electrically
sound, and RCA elected to repair the masts rather than replace them.
     A string 13 upper catenary nuplaglass break which had existed
for several weeks was repaired by 13 December. The repair was facil-
itated by the use of a 144-foot extension ladder fire apparatus which
RCA purchased under fortuitous circumstances. An Argentine organiza-
tion had ordered two of these trucks, and subsequently was unable to
consummate the purchase.
     System Test (Category II) was delayed until 30 August 1971 be-
cause of problems with a PDP-computer and the failure of two trans-
mit/receive (T/R) switches.
     By 3 September it appeared that problems in integrating all
end items into a workable system would delay system test another two
or three weeks. The problems did not appear major when considered
individually, but the system did not perform in the sense that mean-
ingful data could be retrieved at the displays. Most of the problems
appeared to be in the receiver and signal processing areas, since it
was known that the transmitters were working and the antenna was ra-
diating at expected power levels.
     RCA provided four modification kits for the screen regulators,
and system functional tests began on 29 September, except for Relia-
bility and maintainability (R&M) test. R&M, which requires operation
24 hours a day, was delayed until 15 October because repair work on
the damaged masts had to be done during the daylight hours.
     On 9 February 1972 the radar was accepted from the contractor.

 =========================================================================

                Design Verification System Test (DVST)

     DVST began on 10 February 1972. Because or a power short-
age caused by the strike of British coal miners, the test was sus-
pended on 14 February and resumed on 1 March.
     In the DVST, a "noise" problem appeared, and as of 30 June
1972 on-site activity was concentrated on a task force investigation
of noise sources and effects, which were considered to be a limiting
factor in system performance capability.
     Among the prerequisites for the DVST were the XEROX SIGMA V
computer and the Signal Analysis Subsystem (SAS).
     The SIGMA V, leased from XEROX, arrived on-site on 20 July 1971.
subsequently, it was determined to be economically advantageous, over
the life of the system, to buy the computer. Funds for the purchase
were released in February 1972.
     The SAS, purchased under a contract placed by the Army Security
Agency with Interstate Electric Corporation (IEC), was installed
during the first week of January 1972.
     Originally, the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) was to be re-
sponsible for the integration of the SIGMA V/SAS. When NRL said it
would perform only that portion of the integration concerned with
software, the integration was made a responsibility of IEC.

                        Tube Aging Rack

   On 19 July 1971 RCA submitted a fixed-price proposal for the
tube aging rack which included a quote for $800,000 more than the
original proposal, submitted on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis. (Aging:
allowing a permanent magnet, capacitor, meter, or other device to

 =========================================================================

remain in storage for a period of time, sometimes with voltage applied,
until the characteristics of the device become essentially constant.)
     After a study to determine the most advantageous approach, the
Program Director favored a fixed-price procurement, on the basis that
RCA would probably try to recover some of the costs connected with a
deficiency correction of the 4641 tube, under the guise of development
of the tube aging rack.
     By 13 August 1971 RCA's proposal on a fixed-price basis was
$2.6 million, and the Program Office directed that this be negotiated
as a fixed-price Supplemental agreement (SA) rather than cost-plus-
fixed fee as desired by RCA.
     The Defense Contract Administration Services Agency (DCASA)
rejected the RCA proposal, and directed resubmission on the basis
that the $800,000 increase in pricing for a fixed-price contract
was not justified.
     Negotiations were completed in November 1971 at a definitized
figure of $2,446,000.
     The tube aging rack was operational on 30 June 1972.

 =========================================================================

                          RCA Studies

                    A contract was placed with RCA on 12 July 1971
for a technical evaluation and cost trade-off study on the inclusion
of a second beam capability and the addition of antenna strings to
increase the geographical coverage of 441A. Three volumes on the
technical aspects of various configurations and a draft volume on
the cost trade-off were received in December 1971. The final ver-
sion of the cost trade-off volume was received in February 1972.
          RCA was also given a contract for a study of Automated
Data Analysis and Presentation (ADAPT) techniques. The ADAPT study
is intended to determine methods of meeting real-time operational
requirements through the automation of AN/FPS-95 output. A Govern-
ment Working Group established for ADAPT held its first meeting on
25 May 1972.
       
          RCA Proposal for Equitable Adjustment

    The ESD History for Fiscal Year 1971 (PP. 149-150) noted the
RCA proposal for "equitable adjustment" of the 441A contract because
of delays in the program.
    On 16 July 1971 RCA submitted a revised cost proposal in the
amount of $6.3 million (up from $5.56 million).
    In November 1971 final agreement was reached on a settlement
at $3.05 million.

 =========================================================================

                      Cobra Mist

        (1) Based on guidance by Hq USAF, the one year
Design Verification System Tests planned for this system
were terminated after six months on 10 August 1972 and Initial
Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) of the system was 
begun with the Using Command, USAFE as specified by AFR 80-14
in an effort to accelerate the system operational date to
January 1973.

        (2) The testing revealed that the system was plagued
by excessive noise of then undetermined origin which prevented
the system from meeting its operational performance require-
ments. Various on-site and prime contractor efforts to alle-
viate the problem were unsuccessful and resulted on 29 December
1972 in direction by Hq USAF to terminate the IOT&E and to
establish a joint US/UK blue-ribbon scientific team of OTH
experts to determine the cause of the noise problem and rec-
ommend appropriate fixes. As a result, a Scientific Advisory
Committee (SAC) was established which conducted a series of
special tests at the site to isolate the noise source(s).
The committee published its findings in a final report on
1 May 1973 indicating that the noise problem could be over-
come by certain system modifications and that the system
could be brought into an operational state with certain
limitations on its expected capabilities.

        (3) On 19 June 1973, the UK was advised that the
US has decided to close down the site and deactivate the
system on 30 June 1973 based on the SAC findings and other
considerations.

it has been decided that the USAF will not renew the
contract for the operation and maintenance of the

Dear Mr Goudie

This is in reference to your 16 Feb 93 Freedom of Information Act request for
documents that would show the purpose, goals, and operations of Project Cobra
Mist.

A line-by-line declassification review determined that portions of the record
you seek are releasable under the Act. However, some parts are exempt from
disclosure under United States Code, Title 5, Section 552(b) (1) since the
unauthorized disclosure of such information could reasonably be expected to
cause damage to national security and is properly and currently classified in
the interest of national defense, as specifically authorized under the critera
established by Executive order 12356 and implemented by regulation.

Some portions of the information were removed because they did not pertain to
the subject matter of your request.

Should you decide that an appeal to this decision is necessary, you must write
to the Secretary of the Air Force within 60 calendar days from the date of this
letter. Include in your appeal any reasons for reconsideration you wish to
present, and attach a copy of this letter. The appeal should be forwarded to;

(U) {(S)} Cobra Mist, the AN/FPS-95 over-the-horizon (OTH) radar built on the 
English North Sea Coast in the late 1960's to overlook air and missile 
activity in Eastern Europe and the western areas of the USSR, was the most 
powerful and sophisticated radar of its kind up to that time. The design, 
which emulated Naval Research Laboratory's Madre over-the-horizon radar, 
incorporated rather coarse spatial resolution and relied upon ultralinear, 
wide dynamic range components and complex signal processing in attempting to 
achieve the extreme subclutter visibility (scv) of 80 to 90 dB needed to 
separate target returns from the strong ground clutter - a goal well beyond 
the 60-odd decibel subclutter visibility previously  achieved. The detection 
performance of the radar was spoiled, however, because the actual subclutter 
visibility achieved was only 60 to 70 dB, the limitation being due to a noise 
with approximately flat amplitude-versus-doppler frequency, which appeared in 
all range bins containing ground clutter and aircraft returns. Experiments 
performed at the site failed to uncover the source of the noise, either in 
the equipment or in the propagation medium. Other experimental results imply 
that the noise was associated with returns from land areas and not from sea 
surfaces; the possibility of electronic countermeasures was not ruled out. 
Because the source of the noise was not located and corrected, the radar 
program was terminated in June 1973 and the equipment removed from the site. 
The cause of the noise is unknown to this day. 

INTRODUCTION 

This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod; And there is in this business 
more than nature Was ever conduct of: some oracle Must rectify our knowledge.

(U) {(S)}  This paper recounts the story of Cobra Mist, the AN/FPS-95 over-
the-horizon radar built in England on the North Sea Coast in the late 1960's 
and operated there until mid-1973, when the program was discontinued. 

(U) {(S)} As many will remember, the AN/FPS-95 was the largest, most 
powerful, and most sophisticated OTH (over-the-horizon) radar of its time; 
and the OTH community as a whole had high hopes that in performance and 
capability Cobra Mist would set new standards for the OTH radar art. Quite 
the opposite happened, however. The radar was plagued from the beginning by 
difficulties, and although the, problems within the equipment it self - which 
were never very serious - were tracked down and corrected, a residual 
problem, apparently in the external environment, seriously impaired the 
detection performance of the radar and led ultimately to the discontinuance 
of the program. The source of the difficulty that caused Cobra Mist's demise 
was never found. At the conclusion of the program a rather extensive set of 
reports on the program (1) were prepared for the U.S. Air Force, but these 
were not widely distributed. Consequently, the community did not benefit 
fully from the AN/FPS-95 experience. 

(U) {(S)} The authors of this paper were all in some way intimately 
associated with the AN/FPS-95, both in its initial operational phases and in 
the final phase when an all-out, though time-limited, attempt was made to 
locate and correct the critical difficulty.  The point of this paper is to 
give an account of the final phase: to list the

possible causes of the radar's poor performance and to describe the evidence 
for and against those causes as gathered through measurements and tests 
conducted at the site. 

(U) {(S)} The paper begins with a brief history of the AN/FPS-95 program, its 
origins, the design basis, factors that led to the choice of a site in 
England, and the essential features of the difficulties that led to program 
termination. Following that is a careful description of the radar system 
itself, equipment components and all. Next is a discussion of the radar's 
capabilities and limitations, both those that were expected and those that 
were actually observed; the nature of the principal difficulty, the so-called 
"clutter-related noise," is then described. The last three sections treat, in 
turn, some possible causes for the noise: in the radar equipment itself, in 
the external environment in general, and in postulated countermeasure 
activities. The evidence is reviewed and weighed, and inferences are drawn in 
the summary and conclusions section at the end of the text.

the author to be possibly quite significant. 
                                        
                     BRIEF HISTORY OF THE AN/FPS-95 

By the early 1980's, the promise that early experimenters had Seen for long 
range, high-frequency radar apparently had been realized by the Madre OTH 
radar of the Naval Research Laboratory on Chesapeake Bay, when Naval Research 
Laboratory personnel reported detection of aircraft targets at ranges of 
1,500 to 2,000 nmi [2] and of missiles in early launch phase from Cape 
Canaveral. [3] Plans then were made by the U.S. Air Force to incorporate this 
new technology into a radar sensor to be located in Turkey which, looking 
over the Soviet Union, Would gather intelligence data on Soviet missile and 
air activities, at that time the cause of much official concern. 

(U) {(S)} In 1964, the U.S. Air Force solicited bids on the contract 
definition phase of the over-the horizon radar in Turkey. The award was given 
to RCA on the basis of a design approach that closely paralleled the design 
of the Madre radar. In 1965, following contract definition, bids were 
solicited for an operational radar in Turkey, but a hiatus developed when a 
site in Turkey was not made available to the United States. A search for a 
site then was made in other countries, and after some time and negotiation, 
the British offered a site in Suffolk; on the coast of the North Sea near the 
town of Orford. The Air Force accepted this offer, and the program proceeded. 

(U) {(S)} In 1966, the Air Force again solicited bids for an operational OTH 
radar to overlook air and missile activities in the Soviet Union and Eastern 
Europe, this time from England. Program management was assigned to the 
Electronic Systems Division of the Air Force Systems Command at Hanscom Air 
Force Base, Mass. Engineering responsibility before this had been assigned to 
the Rome Air Development Center, Griffiss Air Force Base, N.Y.; scientific 
support was to be furnished by the Naval Research Laboratory. Toward the end 
of 1966, a contract to build the radar was awarded to RCA Corp., Moorestown, 
N.J. The radar had by that time come to be called the AN/FPS-95 with code 
name Cobra Mist. In the United Kingdom, the fact that the system to be 
located on Orford Ness was a radar was classified at the security level of 
"Secret." 

(U) {(S}) Construction of the radar, whose design was still heavily 
influenced by the Naval Research Laboratory's Madre radar, began in mid-1967. 
Possessing capabilities previously unrealized in either experimental or 
operational OTH radar, the AN/FPS-95, it soon became clear, would have to be 
operated initially by a crew of scientist caliber, both to verify the design 
concepts and to develop procedures for the ultimate RAF-USAF operational crew 
to use in illumination of desired regions, detection and tracking of aircraft 
and missile targets, extraction of signatures, and so on. In 1969, plans for 
the scientific program, which was called the Design Verification System 
Testing (DVST), were drawn by the Cobra Mist Working Group, [4] which 
included representatives from most of the U.S. and U.K. over-the-horizon 
radar groups; the DVST program was to have a duration of one year. In early 
1970, The MITRE Corp., Bedford, Mass. branch and the Naval Research 
Laboratory were chosen to conduct the DVST program, and later in mid-1970 the 
Air Force formed the DVST Technical Advisory Committee to assist in the 
technical direction of the program.

When detailed experimental plans were complete in mid-1971, groups from MITRE 
and the Naval Research Laboratory moved to the site, which by then had 
assumed the form shown in the aerial view of Fig. 1. 

(U) {(S)} Technical difficulties with the system delayed both acceptance of 
the radar by the Air Force and the commencement of the DVST program until 
February 1972. From the beginning, the DVST program was hampered by problems, 
the most serious being the appearance of a mysterious noise, which occurred 
in all Doppler filters corresponding to range intervals in which returns from 
the earth's surface (that is, "clutter" returns) were received. The range 
intervals containing the clutter return also contained the returns from the 
missile and aircraft targets the radar was to observe. The level of this 
"clutter-related noise" was high enough to impair seriously the capability of 
the radar to detect aircraft and missile targets, and as time went on, 
activities at the site shifted more and more from DVST to efforts to locate 
the source of the noise and to eliminate it. 

(U) {(S)} The DVST Technical Committee viewed the noise problem with 
increasing alarm and, in the report to the Air Force which followed its 
meeting in November 1972, (5) the Committee recommended that top priority be 
given to solving the noise problem, that control of operations at the site be 
shifted from the Air Force to a civilian scientific director, and that the 
latter mount a coordinated, systematic program to isolate and identify the 
source of the noise. The Air Force on Dec. 27, 1972 moved to put the 
recommendations into effect. 

(U) {(S)} DVST Program was suspended, a scientific director was recruited 
from Stanford Research Institute and a committee, called the Scientific 
Assessment Committee (SAC), was appointed with U.S. and U.K. members. The 
U.S. members previously had no direct involvement with the Cobra Mist 
radar. This committee took a fresh look at the system, system performance, 
and noise data and structured a series of basic experiments (6) to determine 
the source of the noise. These experiments were conducted in the period from 
January to May in 1973, and in the ensuing appraisal it was found that the 
source of the noise

had not been conclusively located. The Scientific Assessment Committee 
submitted its report [7] in May 1973 and the Cobra Mist radar program was 
terminated abruptly on June 30, 1973. Afterward, the radar was dismantled, 
and the components were removed from the site. 

(U) {(S)} So ended a program that had occupied the efforts of hundreds of 
people for an interval of several years and had cost the United States, by 
various estimates, between $100 million and $150 million. The principal 
product was an enigma which has not been resolved to this day.

RADAR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 

(U) {(S-NF)} The AN/FPS-95 over-the-horizon back scatter radar (8) was 
located at Orford Ness on the east coast of England. By beam steering, the 
radar was designed to make observations within a 91-deg azimuth sector 
extending from 19.5 to 110.5 deg clockise from true north. The maximum 
range, assuming one-hop propagation via the ionosphere F-layer, was 
approximately 2,000 nmi, but the equipment would permit the observation of 
suitable, more distant targets using multihop propagation modes. A minimum 
range of approximately 500 nmi was set by the lower radar frequency limit and 
the upper elevation limit of the radar beams. Figure 2 shows the nominal 
coverage of the radar using single-hop propagation modes. The operating 
frequency range extended from 6 to 40 MHz. 

(U) The radar employed the pulse-Doppler method to detect the radar signals 
from moving targets against the much larger return from the earth's surface. 
The waveforms used for search and tracking tasks took the form of radio 
frequency pulses, with durations selectable from 250 to 3,000 microseconds 
and pulse repetition frequencies (PRF) from 40 to 160 pulses/sec. Received 
pulse-trains of selectable lengths were processed in a frequency analyzer, 
which in effect provided a contiguous set of bandpass filters that were 
approximately "matched" in the radar sense for targets with constant Doppler 
frequencies and also for targets with linear Doppler rates of change 
(constant accelerations). An oblique ionospheric sounder mode of operation 
was also available, wherein the earth surface backscatter returns could be 
displayed as functions of radar frequency and propagation time delay. 

(U) To achieve sufficient signal-to-noise ratios against the predicted noise 
background, the radar was capable of very high transmitted power output. A 
peak power of 10 MW and an average power of 600 kW were originally specified, 
although these figures were not achieved in practice. Such high powers were 
incorporated in the design to compensate for the relatively low antenna gain 
of approximately 25 dB. 

(U) {(S)} Both ionospheric propagation limitations and the scarcity of clear 
HF operating frequencies impose severe limitations on the design bandwidths 
of OTH radar signals and therefore on the attainable range resolution. This 
fact, coupled with the broad (7 deg) beamwidth of the AN/FPS-95, resulted in 
a very large radar resolution cell and, consequently, a large earth-surface 
radar backscatter power. To accommodate such large signals without causing 
unacceptably high inter-modulation and cross-modulation effects, a radar 
receiver with the very large linear dynamic range, of 140 dB was provided, 
together with signal processing equipment of commensurate capabilities. A 
simplified block diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 3, and the major 
parameters are summarized in Table 1. 

(U) Following are brief descriptions of the major elements of the AN/FPS-95 
radar. 


ANTENNA 

(U) {(S)} The antenna consisted of 18 log-periodic antenna strings, which 
radiated like spokes in a wheel from a central "hub." Figure 4 is a close-up 
photograph of one such string. Each string was 2,200 ft in length and carried 
both horizontal and vertical radiating dipoles. The strings were separated by 
7 deg in angle, and they thus occupied a 119-deg sector of a circle. The 
complete antenna was located over a wire-mesh ground screen, which extended 
beyond the strings in the propagation direction. 

(U) To form a beam, six adjacent string were connected, by means of a beam-
switching matrix situated underground at the hub of the antenna, to the 
transmit or receive beam-forming networks in the main building. The pointing 
direction of the beam was controlled solely by selecting the appropriate set 
of six adjacent strings from among the 18 available. According to the 
frequency of operation, a specific small section of each log-periodic string 
became resonant. Thus, at high frequencies the active portion would be close 
to the antenna hub, and it would move out toward the larger dipole elements 
as the frequency was lowered. While the linear extent of the active area 
extending across all six strings thus increased as the frequency was lowered, 
the net effect was to produce a beam whose angular dimensions and, hence, 
gain were almost independent of frequency. A simple way to view the action of 
the antenna is to regard it as a six-element broadside array, which moved 
around within the physical boundary of

the antenna structure in response to frequency changes and to the choice of 
strings. 

(U) An important point to consider is that only a small fraction of the total 
physical aperture of the complete antenna was devoted at any one time to the 
task of beam formation. To shape the beam, it was necessary to ensure that 
the correct phase relationships were preserved between each of the six active 
strings. Thus, during transmission, phase shifts were introduced in the outer 
four of the six strings to compensate for the arc-shaped configuration of the 
radiating elements and thereby produce an approximately planar wavefront. 
Each string was driven on transmission by a separate high-power transmitter. 
On reception, beam forming networks offered both in-phase addition to yield 
the "sum" antenna beam shape, similar to the transmission beam, and the 
appropriate phase shifts to yield a monopulse "difference" beam pattern for 
use in estimation of the target's azimuth angle. 

(U) The antenna design parameters are listed in Table 2. A limited set of 
antenna-pattern measurements performed at the site revealed significant 
variations from the design values as a junction of beam position and 
operating frequency. These variations were most pronounced in the elevation 
beamwidths, sidelobes, and beam-pointing directions. 


                          TRANSMITTER-EXCITER 

(U) The transmitter operated in the frequency range of 6 to 40 Mhz. Although 
the design called for peak powers of 10 MW and average powers of 600 kW, in 
practice the peek powers achieved were approximately 3.5 MW. 

(U) The power was generated in six separate linear-distributed amplifiers, 
one of which is shown in Fig. 5. The output from each unit was fed to a 
separate antenna string. The power could be varied over a 20-dB range by 
adjusting the exciter drive level, and harmonic frequencies were filtered 
from the output by means of four sets of switchable low-pass filters. 

(U) The exciter furnished three generic types of amplitude-modulated CW pulse 
shapes as follows:

to remove the ground clutter, and then stored by range cell in preparation 
for analysis by the velocity and acceleration processors. The processing was 
achieved by converting the stored signal back to an analog form and then 
playing them back, greatly speeded up in time, with appropriate frequency 
translations through filters that were matched to the reconstituted pulse 
sequences. By these means, the entire range of Doppler shifts and 
acceleration profiles could be sequentially accommodated during a period 
shorter than that of the original radar pulse train being processed. 
Meanwhile, new signals were being received and stored. The durations of the 
pulse trains thus processed (integration times) were selectable over a range 
from 0.3125 to 20 sec. There was also a facility for recording the raw sigals

verter. These data were then available for analysis off line by the extensive 
progams that were specially developed as part of the DVST activitv or for 
replay through the on-line system. Some of the main receiver and signal 
processor parameters are listed in Table 4. 


DISPLAYS

(U) The signal processor outputs contained data on target range, azimuth, 
velocity, acceleration, and signal amplitude. These parameters, together with 
a time-history dimension, could be shown on a number of cathode ray  tube 
(CRT) displays Intensity modulation was not employed on these displays, with 
the result that only two of the foregoing six parameters were displayable in 
the chosen x-y format at any one time. Some of the remaining parameters could 
be thresholded by manual selection to restrict the number of displayed data. 
From among all the possible combinations of the six parameters taken two at a 
time, the AN/FPS-95 had the capability of displaying 14 such pairs. 

(U) On those displays where the signal amplitude was not one of the exhibited 
parameters, an amplitude threshold had to be chosen. Thus, only those signals 
that exceeded this threshold could be "detectetd" and displayed, as in a 
classical radar signal detection process. Cursors were provided to allow 
readout of parameter values from the displays, and cameras were available for 
a permanent display record. In addition to the presentations on the cathode 
ray tubes, certain data could be recorded on magnetic tape or automatically 
typed.  Figure 6 shows a view of the radar control console with its 
associated displays. 


ANCILLARY EQUIPMENT

(U) To support the AN/FPS-95 operation in the selection of radar operating 
frequencies, the site contained a vertical ionospheric sounder and a panoramic 
radio receiver. 

                    RADAR CAPABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS
                           EXPECTED CAPABILITIES

(U) {(S)}  The AN/FPS-95 was expected to detect and track (a) aircraft in 
flight over the westerly part of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact 
countries and (b) missile launches from the Northern Fleet Missile Test 
Center at Plesetsk. Aircraft detection and tracking at ranges of 500 to 2,000 
nmi, corresponding to one-hop ionospheric propagation, were considered 
feasible. missile launches from Plesetsk were also within one-hop range from 
the radar. A searchlight mode was provided for high-priority targets whose 
approximate locations were known a priori. These targets could be single 
aircraft, compact formations of aircraft, or missile launches. In this mode, 
the radar continuosly illuminated a small geographical area to obtain thc 
maximum data rate on the selected targets. As an alternative, a scanning mode 
was provided, which allowed the radar to search in azimuth and range over any 
chosen sector of the radar coverage 

{SECRET NOFORN}                         UNCLASSIFIED               JDR 297

 ===========================================================================

                           {SECRET NORFORN}          UNCLASSIFIED 

at a reduced data rate ior any particular area. Scanning in asimuth was 
implemented by switching the antenna among the 13 discrete beam positions. 
Range-scanning was implemented by two methods: (a) switching between the 
lower and upper elevation beams and (b) varying the transmitted frequency as 
required by ionospheric propagation conditions to reach the desired range. 
Frequency selection was facilitated by an oblique sounding mode of the radar 
and by a separate vertical sounder. The scanning mode was intended for 
detection of targets whose locations were unknown a priori and for time-
sharing the radar among different missions. 

(U) {(S)} Both accuracy and resolution of the AN/FPS-95 were expected to be 
considerably lower than for a typical Picowave search radar. The azimuth 
beamwidth of 7 deg determined the angular resolution. Monopulse beam-
splitting provided a nominal 1-deg anEular accuracy, but this was further 
limited by ionospheric tilts, which could mmount to several degrees, 
particularly in the northern beams that approachcd the auroral region. The 
unmodulated radar pulses provided only coarse range resolution. With the 
longest pulse, 3 msec in duration, the range resolution equaled 240 nmi. The 
shortest pulse, 250 microsec., provided a nominal 20-nmi range resolution, 
but this pulse could be used only under a limited number of conditions. 
Pulse-splitting in range could be performed manually on the displays to 
obtain a slant range accuracy of perhaps one-third of the range resolution, 
but the accuracy with which slant range could be converted to ground range 
was limited by uncertainties in virtual height of the ionosphere. 

(U) Against this coarse spatial accuracy and resolution was set the fine 
Doppler resolution of the radar. Coherent integration times of 10 sec were 
frequently allowed by the ionospheric propagation medium, providing a range-
rate resolution of 1.5 knots at the midband frequency of 20 Mhz. The fine 
Doppler resolution was intended both for separation of multiple targets and 
for discriminating moving target returns from stationary ground backscatter. 

(U) The expected capability of the AN/FPS-95 were based primsrily upon 
experience with the Madre OTH-B radar constructed in Maryland by the Naval 
Research Laboretory. Aircrait detection and tracking over the North Atlantic 
was reported by Madre experimenters at one-hop ranges on several occssions. 
[2] Missiles launched from Cape Canaveral were also said to have been 
detected. [3] Since the AN/FPS-95, like Madre, was a monostatic pulse Doppler 
HF radar with high transmitter power, coarse spatial resolution, and fine 
Doppler resolution, its detection and tracking performance was expected to be 
roughly similar. The siting of the AN/FPS-95 provided two operational 
differences between it and Madre, however: (a) Interference in the HF band 
was worse in Europe, particularly at night, and (b) ground backscatter was 
usually received by the AN/FPS-95, rather than sea backscatter. 

(U) {(S)} Performance of the AN/FPS-95 was projected (9) using the ITS-78 
ionospheric propagation prediction computer program, (10) as modified by 
MITRE personnel for radar use. This program was designed to support long-
range HF communications, and its utility for predicting OTH-B radar 
performance, a more demanding application, was not established. Nevertheless, 
it was the best tool available at the time and was therefore used. Single-
dwell probability of detection for aircraft was estimated for a 
representative assortment of target areas, and it appeared adequate for a 
searchlight mode with repeated dwells in a given geographical area, but 
marginal for a scanning mode having a low data rate on any particular target. 

(U) {[S]} It was also recognized at the time that ground backscatter would be 
orders of magnitude larger than aircraft returns or missile skin returns. 
Ground backscatter cross section Xs, is given by 

                   Xs = 1/2 Xu R Tb C r sec Ai                          (1) 

Take typical values of the parameters for an example. Setting backscattering 
cross section per unit area Xu equal 0.02 (-17 dB), range R equal 1,350 nmi, 
azimuth beamwidth Tb equal 7 deg, pulse length r equal 1 msec, and angle of 
incidence Ai equal 8 deg, gives Xs, equal to 1.06 X 10^9 m^2 (90.2 dBSM). 
Given a typical aircraft radar cross section Xt of 30 m^2 (14.8 dBSM) at HF, 
the ratio Xt/Xs, equals -75.4 dB. In order to achieve a 10- to 15-dB signal-
to-clutter ratio for high single-dwell probability of detection in a scanning

mode, the pulse Doppler radar signal processor was required to suppress the 
ground backscatter by 85 to 90 dB relative to aircraft returns - that is, to 
provide 85 to 90 dB of subclutter visibility (SCV). Somewhat lower 
probability of detection, and hence less subclutter visibility, would suffice 
for the searchlight mode, where the radar continuously illuminated a given 
target. In an attempt to achieve the required subclutter visibility, great 
care was taken in the design of the radar transmitter to minimize spectral 
noise and in the receiver and signal processor to minimize intermodulations 
and cross modulations and to provide a large linear dynamic range. 

                 DESIGN VERIFICATION SYSTEM TESTING (DVST)

(U) {(S)} Following construction of the AN/FPS-95 and its acceptance by the 
government, a one year research and development program was planned (4) to 
assess its capabilities. The 12 aircraft detection and tracking experiments 
assigned to MITRE during the DVST will be described briefly as a further 
indication of the expected capability of the radar. A number of other 
experiments, including all of the missile detection and tracking experiments, 
were assigned to Naval Research Laboratory and have becn documented by that 
organization.(11)  This paper will therefore discuss only aircraft detection 
and tracking, with which the authors have firsthand experience. 

(U) {(S)} Experiment 202, Radar Aurora, was intended to determine 
experimentally the effects of HF radio aurora on OTH radar design and 
operation. Experiment 104, Signal Detectability, and Experiment 502, Target 
Detection and Calibration, were to determine probability of detection, 
probability of false alarm, and signal-to-noise ratios of detected targets, as 
well as develop procedures to estimate radar cross section of the detected 
targets. Three experiments dealt with real-time tracking of aircraft at the 
radar consoles and were designed to develop and evaluate this capability: 
Experiment 501, Evaluation of Target Window Printout; Experiment 505, 
Tracking Through Azimuth Beams; and Experiment 508, Track Capability and Track 
Sample Rate. One experiment dealt with automatic tracking of aircraft, 
conducted off line on a digital computer. This was Experiment 405, Track-
While-Scan Feasibility. Experiment 506, Range and Azimuth Calibration, was 
intended to provide an absolute spatial calibration using ground transponders. 

(U) {(S)} These eight experiments were intended to assess the general 
capabilities of the radar for aircraft detection. Four other experiments were 
directed toward specific intelligence objectives. Experiment 306, Vertical 
Velocity Estimation with Aircraft, was to exploit the fine Doppler resolution 
of the radar to measure vertical velocity. The Doppler difference between 
alternate ground reflected propagation modes was to be utilized for this 
purpose. Experiment 312, Intelligence from Test Range Calibration Flights, 
surveyed aircraft activity near Plesetsk and other missile test centers. 
Experiment 314, Reconnaissance Aircraft Surveillance, tracked friendly 
aircraft over the Baltic Sea area, providing the only source of over water 
aircraft tracking data. Experiment 315A, Aircraft R&D Test Intelligence, 
observed aircraft at the Ramenskoye and Vladimirovks Flight Test Centers. 

(U) {(S)} Of these 12 experiments, three were carried out and documented: 
Experiments 202,(12) 405,(13) and 506,(14) The rest were not completed for 
either of two reasons: (a) The experiment as conceived proved too ambitious 
for the actual capability of the radar or (b) the scientist assigned to the 
experiment was reassigned to efforts to improve the radar capability. 

                   OBSERVED CAPABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS

(U) {(S)} Once DVST got under way at Orford Ness, it becsme apparent to the 
MITRE team (and others) on site that the actual radar capabilities were a good 
deal less then the expected capabilities. In the searchlight mode, aircraft 
detection and tracking were marginal, even when aircraft flight plans were 
known a priori. When the radar was carefully operated, with due regard for 
range and Doppler ambiguities end ionospheric propagetion conditions, tracking 
trials on known aircraft in the searchlight mode produced tracks less than 
half the time. Furthermore, the tracks obtained were discontinuous, the 
aircraft return usually being above the noise level only near the peaks of the 
Faraday rotation and multipath fading cycles. Additionally, routine 
observations of areas of high air traffic density, such as air routes near 
Moscow, in the searchlight mode often produced few or no target detections at 
times of day when the propa-

                           {SECRET NORFORN}          UNCLASSIFIED 

gation was good and the aircraft density in the illuminated area was known to 
be high. 

(U) {(S)} Capability in a scanning mode was essentially nonexistent, because 
of both the unexpectelily low signal-to-noise ratio on aircraft returns and 
the difficulty of making appropriate frequency selections for the large 
number of scan positions. In practice, the poor performance in the 
searchlight mode discouraged the experimenters from making much use of the 
more ambitious scanning mode. 

(U) {(S)} Some general observations during aircraft detection and tracking 
are worth recording, in light of the later discussion on the phvsical 
phenomena limiting radar performance. 

    1. (U) {(S)} Daytime performance was much better than nightime 
    performance.  this was unexpected, because D-region absorption is much 
    higher during the day than at night. Such diurnal variation in 
    performance is the opposite of long-range HF communications experience. 

    2. (U) {(S)} Aircraft could be detected and tracked over the Baltic Sea 
    better than over land in most cases. 

    3. (U) {(S)} Aircraft detectability was not maximized at the angle of 
    maximum ground backscatter, but rather at a somewhat greater range, often 
    near the trailing edge of the ground backscatter. It was surmised that 
    aircraft returns fell off with range more slowly than ground backscatter, 
    since the radar cross section (RCS) of aircraft Xt, is independent of 
    range, whereas Xs increases as grazing incidence is approached; that is, 
    Xo increases much faster than R increases in Eq. (1). 

    4. (U) {(S)} Shorter pulses and higher PRF's generally provided more 
    aircraft detections than longer pulses and lower PRF's. This observation 
    is consistent with a clutter-limited radar whose subclutter visibility 
    increases with Doppler shift. 

(U) {(S)} As experience was gained with the An/FPS-95, the factors limiting 
radar periormance became clear. These were clear channel availability, a lack 
of radio frequencies below 6 MHZ, the two-level radar displays, and (worst of 
all) the limited subclutter visibility. A clear channel is a 5-kHz frequency 
band in which no significant interference esists; that is, the noise power 
spectral density approximates the atmospheric and galactic noise predictions 
of CCIR Report 322 [15] or the rural man-made noise model of the ITS-78 
report, [10] whichever is larger. In the searchlight mode, one could take a 
few minutes to look carefully for a clear channel, but this was not possible 
for the scanning mode. During the day, clear channels were generally 
available at Orford Ness, particularly, for illuminating the longer one-hop 
ranges with radio frequencies above 20 MHz. Clear channels were less often 
available at night, when radio frequencies from 6 to 8 MHz were required. The 
large number of HF radio stations in Europe all operated in the same 
frequency region at night, Particularly the 41-meter and 49-meter 
international shortwave bands. The fact that the radar could not operate 
below 6 MHZ alo limited performance at night, since the maximum usable 
frequency (MUF) for the shorter one-hop ranges was sometimes below 6 MHz. The 
shorter ranges could not be illuminated by the radar when this occurred. 

(U) {(S)} The radar displays were also a significant limitation of real-time 
aircraft detection and tracking. The Doppler-time and Doppler-range displays 
had only two intensity levels - on and off. The lack of a grey scale to show 
a dynamic range of signal and noise amplitudes made target detection 
difficult. Setting the on/off amplitute threshold appropriately for fading 
targets in a fluctuating noise level that varied from range bin to range bin 
was a challenging task. Better target detection and tracking were obtained 
offline with computer generated displays having an amplitude scale, some of 
which are illustrated later in the paper. An improved online radar display 
was developed [16] and brought to the AN/FPS-95 site just before the radar 
was shut down. While this had only a very brief trial, it did show promise of 
considerably improved detection and tracking capability compared to the radar 
displays. 

(U) {(S)} The most important constraint on radar performance was the limited 
subclutter visibility. Instead of 4 projected 85- to 90-dB subclutter 
visibility, the radar was found to have only 60- to 70-dB subclutter 
visibility. Target detectibility was degraded by a noiselike clutter residue 
which

often could be 20 dB, and in some cases even 30 dB, higher than the level of 
external noise received by the radar. Figure 7 is a photograph of the AN/FPS-
95 Doppler-range display taken early in the DVST. (17) The range scale 
(horizontal) extends from 0 to 2,000 nmi, the nominal unambiguous range at a 
PRF of 40 Hz. The Doppler scale (vertical) extends from 3 to 20 Hz, with 
approaching and receding Doppler shifts folded together. A Doppler shift of 
20 Hz corresponds to a radial velocity of 264 knots at the radio frequency of 
22.1 MHz employed to obtain these data. Ground backscatter in the 0- to 3-Hz 
region is suppressed by the digital clutter filter. In some range bins, 
corresponding to the skip zone for ionospheric propagation, the noise level 
is below the display threshold in all Doppler bins. In the succeeding range 
bins, generally corresponding to the ranges of first-hop ground backscatter, 
the noise level in all Doppler bins is much higher, hindering target 
detection. 

(U) {(S)} That the noise seen on the radar was in fact clutter-related was 
demonstrated clearly, by turning off the radar transmitters. This caused the 
display of Fig. 7 to go black. When the threshold was readjusted to observe 
the noise level, it was observed to be constant with range, as one would 
expect from external noise. After a number of such observations, it became 
apparent that even if a clear channel could be found, even if ionospheric 
propagation to the desired geographical area existed at the clear channel 
frequency, and even if the radar display limitations could be overcome, the 
excess noise would still provide a severe limitation on radar performance. 
Therefore, in parallel with DVST, an effort to characterize the excess 
noise was undertaken on site. 

                    CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EXCESS NOISE

(U) {(S)} The radar displays presented the excess noise in a dramatic way, but 
a quantitative characterization of the phenomenon required the use of off-line 
digital signal processing programs. (18) The output of one of these programs 
is illustrated in Fig. 8 for data recorded near 7:00 Greenwich mean time on 
March 4, 1972 (Day 64) in beam 11 with vertical polarization at 22.1 MHz - the 
same data as previously illustrated in Fig. 7. The variation of ground 
backscatter (clutter) and excess noise amplitude with slant range is plotted 
in Fig. 8. Note that the clutter curve is moved downward by 50 dB to 
facilitate comparison with the noise curve. Ground-clutter amplitude was 
computed by peak selection in a +-1.5-Hz Doppler window. The amplitude of 
excess noise was computed by averaging the squared modulus of the digital 
signal processor output over all Doppler bins from 3 to 20 Hz on either side 
of the carrier, that is, over all those Doppler bins outside the radar clutter 
filter rejection band. The digital signal proccssor performed a fast Fourier 
transform (FFT) over 512 successive radar pulses in each 12.8-sec coherent 
integration interval. The plotted clutter and noise powers were then further 
noncoherently averaged over 15 successive coherent integration intervals. 

(U) {(S)} One sees in Fig. 8 a marked variation of the excess nolse amplitude 
with slant range. Strong excess noise exists at short range, in the skip zone 
just ahead of the ground clutter, and at the range of the ground clutter. The 
excess noise near the range of peak ground backscatter varies with range in 
direct proportion to the backscatter,

but the excess noise at short range and in the skip zone does not. To 
distinguish between the excess noise that occur ahead of the ground clutter 
and the excess noise that occurs at the range of round clutter, special 
terminology was used at the site. All sources of excess noise that varied with 
range were termed "range-related noise" (RRN). The portion of the excess 
noise that coincided in range with ground clutter was termed "clutter-related 
noise" (CRN). Although all of the range-related noise was of scientific 
interest, only the clutter-related noise interfered with detection of 
aircraft, which was the primary mission of the radar. To better characterize 
range-related noise, Figs. 9 and 10 were generated from the same data. (17) 
Here, the average power of range-related noise is computed separately for 
approaching and receding Doppler bins. In Fig. 9, noise power is averaged over 
Doppler bins 3 to 10 Hz from the carrier, while in Fig. 10 noise power is 
averaged over Doppler bins 10 to 20 Hz from the carrier. One sees that the 
clutter-related noise near the range of peak ground backscatter has a 
symmetrical spectrum close in (3 to 10 HZ) and a nearly

symmetrical spectrum farther out (10 to 20 HZ). The range-related noise in 
the skip zone, on the other hand, has considerably more power in receding 
Doppler bins than in approaching Doppler bins. So does the range-related 
noise at short range, Particularly from the 3- to 10-HZ Doppler bins. By 
comparing Figs. 9 and 10, one sees that range-related noise does decrease 
with increasing Doppler shift, although the true spectral extent of the 
range-related noise is obscured by the spectral replication that occurs at 
the radar PRF of 40 Hz. 

(U) {(S)} A more graphic, if less quantitative, presentation of the computer-
processed data is given in Figs. 11 and 12. [17]  Amplitude versus frequency 
(Doppler) is plotted over a +- 20-Hz band for successive 80-nmi radar-range 
bins during one particular 12.8-sec coherent integration interval. Figure 11 
shows the approaching Doppler bins, while Fig. 12 shows the receding Doppler 
bins. This presentation shows the variation of range related noise with range 
and Doppler quite clearlv. To show the temporal fluctuation in noise level, 
as well as the spectral rolloff, Fig. 13 shows amplitude versus Doppler 
during successive coherent integration intervals, for radar-range bin 17, 
which is at 1,280-nmi slant range, near the peak of the ground backscatter. 
The data in Figs. 11, 12, and 13 are thresholded, which has been found to 
produce a more easily interpreted display.  The

threshold for Fig. 13 is 20 dB higher than the thresholds of Figs. 11 and 12 
to show the clutter related noise peaks more clearly. 

(U) {(S)} Figure 14 shows amplitude versus Doppler during successive coherent 
integration intervals for radar-range bin 23, which is 480 nmi behind the 
peak of the ground backscatter, but still illuminateld by one-hop ionospheric 
refraction. [17]  In particular, this range bin, at a slant- range of 1,760 
nmi, represents a ray path elevation of only a few degrees at ground level 
for one-hop propagation by means of the F2 layer of the ionosphere. The 
amplitude of range-related noise is much lower in range bin 23 than in range 
bin 17, which can be seen by noting that Fig. 14 has a threshold 20 dB lower 
than that of Fig. 13. One also notes in Fig. 14 a number of possible aircraft 
tracks (large amplitude returns isolated in Doppler and forming a Doppler-
time trace) from the geographical area illuminated, which contained a number 
of Soviet military airfields. All of these apparent target returns in range 
bin 23 are well below the level of clutter-related noise seen in range bin 
17. Thus, if the tardets were in range bin 17, 480 nmi closer to the radar, 
they probably would not have been detected, even allowing for a 5.5-dB 
greater radar return due to the decreased range. Figure 14 illustrates the 
contention made earlier that aircraft detectability was not maximized at the 
range of peak ground backscatter, but rather at somewhat greater ranges, 
where grazing incidence for ground backscatter was approached. 

(U) {(S)} The radar data illustrated, taken on a single day early in the DVST 
period, are reasonably representative, of the range-related noise phenomenon. 
Characteristics of range-related noise observed throughout the period of 
AN/FPS-95 operation are summarized here : 

    1. (U) {(S)} Range-related noise was observed predominately at three 
    positions: at short range, in the skip zone ahead of the ground 
    backscatter, and at the ranges of ground backscatter. 

    2. (U) {(S)} Both components of range-related noise had asymmetrical 
    frequency spectra, with more power in receding Doppler than in 
    approaching Doppler. The clutter-related noise at the ranges of ground 
    backscatter generally had a more symmetrical frequency spectrum. Range-
    related noise decreased slowly with increasing Doppler shift in all three 
    cases. 

    3. (U) {(S)} The amplitude ratio of ground backscatter to clutter-related 
    noise near the range of peak ground backscatter (where the radar was 
    intended to detect targets) was relatively constant, being in the range 
    of 60 to 70 dB. 

    4. (U) {(S)} The amplitude ratio between range-related noise and external 
    noise (noise received with the transmitter off) was more variable, 
    depending on both the absolute level of ground backscatter and the level 
    of external noise. Ratios varying from 10 to 30 dB were typical. The only 
    times range-related noise exceeded external noise by less than 10 dB were 
    the times when geogaphical areas of interest were weakly illuminated or 
    the externel noise level was very high. These were times, of course, when 
    the radar would have had little detection and tracking capability, even 
    in the absence of clutter-related noise. 

    5. (U) {(S)} Range-related noise was observed to occur at all times of 
    the day, in all seasons, in all beams, at all radio frequencies, in both 
    polarizations, and so on. It was not an isolated phenomenon. 


THE SEARCH FOR SOURCES OF EXCESS NOISE IN THE RADAR

(U) {(S)} Once the effects of clutter-related noise on radar performance were 
understood, the AN/FPS-95 underwent extensive testing to see if the clutter-
related noise might be originating in the equipment itself. There were two 
motives for first testing the radar itself before carrying the investigation 
to possible external causes of clutter-related noise: 

    1. (U) {(S)} Before using the radar as a test instrument to look for 
    causes of clutter-related noise in the ionospheric propagation medium or 
    in reflection phenomena in the target space, it was necessary to verify 
    that the radar itself was not the principal cause of the observed 
    clutter-related noise. 

(U) {(S)} It was thought that, if sources of clutter-related noise could be 
located in the radar equipment, they could probably be alleviated

{SECRET NOFORN}                         UNCLASSIFIED               JDR 305

     UNCLASSIFIED           {SECRET NORFORN}          

    by repair or modification of the offending components. If, on the other 
    hand, sources of clutter-related noise were found in the propagation 
    medium or in the target space, little could be done to improve radar 
    performance short of extensive redesign of the radar for better spatial 
    resolution. 

(U) {(S)} The results of this extensive radar testing are described here. 
First is a concise account of each of the principal tests conducted. The 
tests are grouped according to the radar component tested, rather than 
chronologically. Second, the main equipment-related, hypothesized causes of 
clutter related noise are listed and compared with the test results by means 
of a matrix. Third, the overall conclusions of the radar testing are given, 
namely, that the radar hardware was not the principal cause of clutter-
related noise. 


EQUIPMENT TESTS FOR CLUTTER-RELATED NOISE

(U) {(S)} The equipment test descriptions, while not a complete account of 
all tests conducted on site, represent most of the tests for which 
documentation is available, and we believe they give a reasonably 
comprehensive picture of the radar's capabilities. Tests of the radar 
transmitting chain are described first. The objective of these tests was to 
measure spectral noise on the transmitted signal, to see if it was comparable 
in amplitude to the levels of clutter-related noise observed on ground 
clutter. 

Test 1: Transmitter Noise Level [18]

* (U) Description: Measure spectral noise level of HPA #4 at 10 and 30 Hz 
  from carrier frequency. 
* (U) Results: Noise level was 98 tQ 102 dB below carrier at 10 HZ and 102 to 
  107 dB below at 30 HZ.
* (U) Frequencies: 7, 13, 18, and 27 MHZ.
* (U) Dates: January and February 1973. 

Test 2: Fan Dipole on Sea Wall #1 [20]

* (U) Description: Transmit at high power from one or more strings of the 
  radar antenna.  Connect vertically polarized fan dipole to radar receiver 
  and signal processor and measure spectral noise level. 
* (U) Resuts: Noise level was down 80 to 100 dB with radar antenns vertically 
  polarized at all frequencies. With radar antenna horizontally polarized, 
  noise level was down only 37 dB in 10- to 15-MHZ frequency band, but down 
  70 to 85 dB at frequencies above 17.5 MHz. Spectral noise was linear with 
  transmitter power. 
* (U) Frequencies: Various. 
* (U) Date: Oct. 30, 1972. 

Test 3: Fan Dipole on Sea Wall #2 [21]

* (U) Description: Transmit at full power from five strings of beam 13. 
  Connect fan dipole to receiver gnd signal processor and measure noise 
  level. 
* (U) Results: Spectral noise down 91 to 94 dB with both radar antenna and 
  fan dipole vertically polsrized. 
* (U) Frequency: 20.67 MHZ. 
* (U) Date: Unknown. 

(U) {(S)} A number of receiving chains tests are now described, each directed 
toward a possible cause of clutter-related noise. The objective of these 
tests was to determine the linear dynamic range of the radar receiver end 
other components in the receiving chain, to see if the observed clutter 
related noise could be originating in the receiving chain. The general 
approach was to inject test signals of high spectral purity at various points 
in the receive chain and to measure the resulting spectral noise st various 
output points. 

Test 4: Receiver Linear Dynamic Range [19]

* (U) Description: Input-output testing of receiver was performed to measure 
selectivity, noise figure, linearity, and dynamic range. 
* (U) Results: Receiver performance was close to design goals. Spurious-free 
dynamic range was 111 to 122 dB. 
* (U) Frequencies: All receiver bands, 6 to 40 MHZ. 
* (U) Dates: January and February 1973 

Test 5: Receiver Intermodulation [22]

* (U) Description: Measure in-band intermodulation (IM) levels at several 
frequencies. 
* (U) Results: In the 6- to 15-MHz band, the fifth order intermodulation 
product was down 74 to 77 dB for -18 dBM in-band input signal; the ninth-
order intermodulotion product was down 82 to 85 dB. These were worst cases, 
since (a) most intermodulation products were considerably lower, and (b) a
-18 dBM input signal is much larger than average. 
* (U) Frequencies: 7, 8, 9, 12, 16, 19, 20, and 35 MHZ. 
* (u) Dates: Feb. 14, Feb. 16, and March 23, 1972.

                    {SECRET NOFORN}      UNCLASSIFIED                    

* (U) Description: Inject two test signals 10 HZ apart at 1 HZ from the 
  desired signal. Measure the cross modulation level on the desired signal. 

* (U) Results: The cross modulation level was 82 to 85 dB down from the 
  desired signal for a - 10 dBM out-of-band input, in the worst case. 
  Duplexer cross modulation effects were negligible. 

* (U) Frequencies: 8 and 16 MHZ.

* (U) Dates: April 22 and April 28, 1972.


Test 7: Radio-frequency Hardware Measurements [19]

* (U)  Description: Measure spurious-free dynamic range of transmit/receive 
  diodes and megnetic elements in the beam-forming network. 

* (U) Resuts: No degradation in subclutter visibility by these components was 
  found, unless electromagnetic interference (EMI) approaches 0 dBM, which is 
  rare. 

* (U) Frequencies: Not given.

* (U) Dates: January and February 1973.


Test 8: Electromagnetic Interference Measurements [24]

* (U) Description: Measure the power level of interfering HF signals at the 
  receiver input, mostly in beam 7 with horizontal polarization. 

* (U) Results: Out-of-band electromagnetic interference sometimes exceeded 
  receiver ratings below 15 MHZ. Out-of-band electromagnetic interference 
  seldom exceeded receiver ratings above 15 MHZ. 

* (U) Frequencies: 5 to 10, 10 to 15, 15 to 20, and 20 to 25 MHZ.

* (U) Dates: Dec. 28 through 30, 1971.


Test 9: Simulated Clutter into Receiver [25]

* (U) Description: Inject a simulated clutter signal into the receiver at a 
  range in the skip zone, ahead of actual ground clutter received in beams 1, 
  7, and 13 during full-power operation of the radar transmitter. 

* (U) {(S-NF)} Results: Spectral noise level on simulated clutter was at 
  least 80 dB down, while clutter-related noise on actual clutter was only 60 
  to 70 dB down. 

* (U) frequencies: 17.4, 18.4, and 22.1 MHZ.

* (U) Dates: June 2, 3, and 9, 1972.


Test 10: Receiver Attenuation [25]

* (U) Description: Attenuate rcceived ground clutter from beam 7 at the 
  receiver input in 6-dB steps to 30 dB. 

* (U) {(S-NF)} Results: Clutter and clutter-related noise at the signal 
  processor output were linear with receiver attenuation, indicating that 
  receiver overload was not a source of clutter-related noise. 

* (U) Frequency: 17.4 MHZ.

* (U) Date: June 3, 1972.

(U) {(S-NF)} Next, a number of tests of the radar antenna on reception are 
described. Spectrally clean test signals were radiated toward the radar 
antenna from various points in the local area, and the received signals were 
examined for spectral noise of a level comparable to the observed clutter-
related noise. One might note that extensive rework of the antenna was 
undertaken by the contractor (RCA) from Aug. 4 to Sept. 17, 1972. Antenna 
tests before the repairs were made showed a higher level of spectral noise 
than subsequent tests, which tended to exonerate the reworked antenna as the 
principal cause of clutter related noise.


Test 11: Loop Antenna at the focal point [25]

* (U) Description: Radiate a simulated clutter signal from a loop antenna 
  located at the geometrical focal point of the radar antenna. Receive on

EQUIPMENT COMPONENTS AS POSSIBLE SOURCES of CLUTTER-RELATED NOISE

(U) {(S)} All components of the, radar, including its local environment, were 
considered as possible sources of clutter-related noise. For each component, 
one or more physical mechanisms capeble of generating clutter-related noise 
were hypothesized. These mechanisms (see Table 5) were then considered in 
structuring the equipment tests for clutter-related noise. Table 6 summarizes 
the results of the 20 equipment tests as described earlier with respect to 
sources of clutter-related noise in each radar component. A minus sign (-) 
means that a given radar component was found not to be a significant source 
of clutter-related noise; a plus sign (+) means that a component was found to 
be significant. Many squares in the table are left blank, Indicating no 
conclusive relationship between a given equipment test and a given radar 
component. 

(U) {(S)} Spectral noise on the radar transmitter output could cause clutter-
related noise to appear on ground clutter. The ratio of clutter to clutter 
related noise expected would be approximately equal to the ratio of carrier 
to spectral noise on the transmitter output, if such spectral noise were the 
principal cause of clutter-related noise. The transmitter noise level 
measurement (Test 1) showed a very low level of spectral noise - much too low 
to account for the observed clutter-related noise. A test using a fan dipole 
on the sea wall (Test 3) also showed transmitted spectral noise to be much 
lower than the generally observed clutter-related noise. The two overall 
system tests using a repeater (Tests 17 and 18) also tended to clear the 
transmitter as a cause of clutter-related noise. Finally, the observed 
linearity of clutter-related noise with transmitter power (Test 19) was an 
indication that nonlinear effects in the transmitter were not a significant 
source of clutter-related noise. 

(U) {(S)} Receiver testing was more extensive than transmitter testing, in 
part because numerous tests of the radar antenna also implicitly tested the 
radar receiver. Tests of receiver linearity, dynamic range, intermodulation 
distortion, and cross modulation distortion (Tests 4, 5, and 6) showed that 
the spectral noise imposed upon received ground clutter by these receiver 
phenomena should be much lower than the levels of clutter-related

noise actually observed, thus showing that the receiver was not the major 
cause of clutter-related noise. The electromagnetic interference measurements 
(Test 8) showed that out-of-band electromagnetic interference occasionally 
exceeded receiver ratings, which could allow cross modulation in the receiver 
to cause significant clutter-related noise. However, such large out-of-band 
electromagnetic interference was rare, whereas clutter related noise was 
observed all the time when ground clutter was strong. Testing of the receiver 
with simulated clutter (Test 9) showed spectral noise on the simulated 
clutter to be smaller than observed clutter-related noise on actual clutter 
received at the same time. Actual clutter and clutter-related noise were also 
shown to be linear with received signal attenuation (Test 10), thus 
indicating that receiver overload wss not a cause of clutter-related noise. 

(U) {(S)} Antenna reception Tests 13 through 16 incduded the receiver in the 
test chain. Since low levels of spectral noise were observed, these tests 
also exonerated the receiver as the principal cause of clutter-related noise. 
For example, the test employing a vertical dipole on the sea wall as a 
signal source (Test 13) showed spectral noise down 91 to 95 dB from the 
carrier, which is far lower than the clutter-related noise-to-clutter ratios 
commonly observed. Transmit and receive system tests employing a signal 
repeater (Tests 17 and 18) also tended to exonerate the receiver, although 
the spectral noise in these cases was not quite so low, because of the 
limitations of the repeater.

(U) {(S)} The receiving chain and signal repeater tests also indicated that 
the radar signal processor and displays were not the cause of clutter-related 
noise. That is, spectrally clean test signals injected ahead of the signal 
processor were observed on the displays to be not corrupted with spectral 
noise to anything near the level of clutter-related noise observed on actual 
ground clutter. There was a further indication that all the radar signal 
processor circuits after the analog-to-digital converter had adequate linear 
dynamic range to properly spectrum analyze ground clutter. An off-line 
digital signal processor was developed by MITRE [18] to supplement the on-
line hybrid digital/analog radar signal processor. Careful comparison of 
clutter related noise at the output of the off-line digital processor with 
clutter-related noise observed on the radar displays showed very close 
agreement in amplitude, spectrum, and time variation. While it is possible 
that both processors might have had an undetected flaw, it is extremely 
unlikely that both would have had exactly the same flaw. 

(U) {(S)} A lingering doubt does exist about one component of the signal 
processor-the analog-to digital converter. A colleague [30] has put forth the 
hypothesis that analog-to-digital converter transient response errors in 
following time-varying clutter might account for the spectrally spread 
clutter-related noise. Since all test signals, both CW and pulsed, had 
constant amplitude from one radar pulse repetition interval to the next, the 
transient response of the analog-to-digital converter may not have been 
adequately tested, according to this hypothesis. At this late date, there 
appears no way to resolve this question. 

(U) {(S)} Four tests of the radar antenna, ground screen and RF hardware were 
conducted in the spring and summer of 1972, before RCA reworked these 
components. The transmitter power reduction test 19 tended to rule out 
nonlinear effects in the transmitting antenna, such es arcing and corona, as 
the principal cause of clutter-related noise, but it was too limited in scope 
to be wholly conclusive. Cross-modulation distortion in the duplexers was 
measured in conjunction with similar receiver measurements (Test 6) and found 
to be negligible. Two early tests of the antenna on reception gave positive 
results, however. Spectrally clean test signals that were radiated from a 
loop antenna at the geometric focal point of the radar antenna (Test 11) 
showed spectral noise at the signal processor output comparable in amplitude 
to the clutter-related noise simultaneously observed on ground clutter. When 
a vertical monopole on the sea wall was used to radiate a spectrally clean 
test signal (Test 12) to the radar antenna, spectral noise was also observed 
at the signal processor output. With the radar antenna vertically polarized, 
spectral noise on the test signal was lower than the clutter-related noise 
usually observed on ground clutter. However, with the radar antenna 
horizontally polarized (cross polarized to the test signal), spectral noise 
on the test signal at some frequencies was higher than the clutter-related 
noise usually observed on ground clutter. The results of these two tests were 
taken as an indication that at least some of the clutter-related noise was 
originating in the radar antenna on reception - possibly in the ground 
screen, because it could produce cross-polarized spectral noise. 

(U) As a result of these early antenna tests, a team of engineers from RCA 
Moorestown, the AN/FPS-95 contractor, came to the site in the fall of 1972. 
They inspected the antenna, ground screen, and RF hardware, had extensive 
repairs and rework done, and then participated in further tests of the 
reworked antenna. Rework of the antenna was conducted between Aug. 4 and 
Sept. 17, 1972. Expansion sections in the RF hardware and the ground screen 
clips were both found to generate spectral noise during two-tone 
intermodulation tests; corroded joints were also found by visual inspection. 
The expansion sections were replaced, steel towers in the antenna field were 
rewelded to reduce nonlinear RF effects at joints, grounding connections were 
improved, and the ground screen clips were welded, Coaxial lines to the 
baluns were modified and grounded, as were certain conduits and fan plates. 
All loose metal debris in the antenna field was removed. 

(U) After the rework, extensive testing of the antenna on both transmission 
and reception was performed. Transmitting tests were directed toward both 
linear sources of spectral noise, such as wind vibration, and nonlinear 
sources, such as arcing and corona. Receiving tests took into account wind 
vibration also, as well as nonlinear effects, such as rectifying action at 
joints in the antenna and ground screen.

(U) {(S)} Transmission from the radar antenna to a fan dipole on a sea wall 
(Tests 2 and 3) showed low spectral noise when the radar antenna and test 
antenna had the same polarization, but higher spectral noise when the two 
antennas were cross polarized. This indicated that some spectral noise 
generation mechanisms still existed in the antenna on transmission, 
especially at the lower operating frequencies, but that these were probably 
not the principal cause of clutter-related noise. In this regard, it should 
be noted that the spectral noise uncovered in cross-polarization testing was 
concentrated in the region of 10 to 30 HZ from the carrier, whereas clutter-
related noise associated with ground clutter had a spectrum that fell off 
slowly, but monotonically, with Doppler shift. while cross-polarization 
testing was a good way to uncover spectral noise generation mechanisms in the 
antenna, it (differed too much from normal radar operation to be readily 
interpreted in terms of the clutter-related noise that could be expected on 
actual ground clutter. The two repeater tests of the whole radar system 
(tests 17 and 18) showed no noise generation in the antenna, within the 
limits of the instrumentation. Finally, a comparison of clutter to clutter-
related noise ratios between one string of the radar antenna and an auxiliary 
test antenna having a roughly similar radiation pattern (Test 20) showed no 
significant differences. This was a further indication that the radar antenna 
was not the principal cause of clutter-related noise. 

(U) {(S)} Several reception tests were also performed on the reworked 
antenna. The RF hardware measurements (Test 7) showed no significant source 
of clutter-related noise, unless the level of electro-magnetic interference 
at the antenna terminals approached 0 dBM, which rarely occurred. Spectrally 
clean test signals were radiated toward the receiving antenna (Tests 13 
through 16) from the sea wall, from a helicopter, and from an aircraft. The 
sea wall provided a stable mounting point for a test antenna, allowing very 
low levels of spectral noise (more than 90 dB down from the carrier) to be 
observed at the signal processor output. However, the sea wall was not in the 
far field of the antenna and was lower in elevation than either of the radar 
elevation beams. The helicopter and aircraft tests were intended to get 
further from the antenna and in the mainlobe of one of the radar elevation 
beams. These tests also showed the radar antennas on reception to be 
relatively free of spectral noise generation, but not to the degree of the 
sea wall tests, because the airborne platforms were not sufficiently stable. 
It might be noted that some of these tests were done on windy days, so the 
hypothesis that wind vibration of radar antenna elements caused clutter-
related noise was thoroughly tested. Wind vibration was shown to produce some 
spectral noise, but was a minor contributor to the observed levels of clutter 
related noise. 

(U) {(S)} The local environment of the radar system was included in some of 
the equipment tests for clutter-related noise. Receiving chain tests with the 
helicopter-borne test antenna (Test 14) and the airborne one-way measurements 
(Test 16) included some of the sea within the first Fresnel zone of the 
antenna ground plane. Most of the first Fresnel zone was within the aircraft 
test range of 4 miles; only part was within the helicopter test range of 1/2 
mile. Both of these tests showed received spectral noise almost 90 dB down 
from the carrier at the Doppler frequencies of interest. Apparently, 
significant modulation of the signal by sea waves was confined to smaller 
Doppler shifts. The low level of spectral noise observed during these tests 
also negated the hypothesis that clutter-related noise might be caused by 
cross-modulation effects in ancillary equipment near the radar site, such as 
transmission lines, power stations, and so on. 

(U) {(S)} The aircraft repeater measurements (Test 18) were conducted with 
the repeater at a range 4 miles from the radar. These measurements uncovered 
no spectral noise that could be attributed to the local environment. Because 
of instrumentation limitations, this test was not quite as conclusive as the 
one-way receiving chain tests. Both the aircraft repeater test and the 
auxiliary antenna measurements (Test 20) made use of a Yagi-Uda antenna 
located about 1/2 mile south of the radar antenna. During these tests, no 
significant differences in spectral noise on test signals or in clutter 
related noise on ground clutter were found between the two antennas. This was 
a further indication that local environmental effects, which were some what 
spatially decorrelated between the two antennas, were not the principal cause 
of clutter-

related noise. One further piece of evidence - the absence of nonlinear 
effects during the transmitter power reduction Test 19 - tended to negate the 
hypothesis of cross modulation in ancillary equipment.


CONCLUSIONS OF EQUIPMENT TESTING

(U) {(S)} Numerous tests of the AN/FPS-95 transmitter showed it to have 
exceptional spectral purity and to be a negligible contributor to the overall 
level of clutter-related noise. The radar receiver, always a prime suspect as 
the cause of clutter-related noise, was very thoroughly tested for spectral 
noise generation. It, too, was exonerated, except when very large out-of-band 
inteferers were present at the receiver input. Since such interferers were 
rarely present, whereas clutter-related noise was always present when OTH 
propagation was good, it was concluded that the radar receiver was not the 
principal cause of clutter-related noise. The radar signal processor was 
shown through numerous tests to not be a significant source of clutter-
related noise. A minority opinion [30] would have it that these tests did not 
adequately measure the analog-to-digital converter transient response to 
time-varying clutter. 

(U) {(S)}  Some spectral noise generation mechanisms were found in the 
AN/FPS-95 antenna, ground screen, and RF hardware. After extensive rework of 
these components by RCA, such noise generation mechanisms were considerably 
reduced, but still present. Extensive system testing on both transmission and 
reception showed that the antenna, ground screen, and RF hardware were not 
the principal cause of clutter-related noise. These components had 
particularly good spectral purity above 20 MHZ, whereas clutter-related noise 
on actual ground clutter was just as prevalent as it was to lower radio 
frequencies. Some tests of the radiating system also included its local 
environment, particularly the sea. The local environment seemed no 
significant source of such noise. 

(U) {(S)}  Having rather thoroughly exonerated the radar equipment as the 
limiting source of clutter-related noise, attention turned to factors 
external to the radar. Both the ionospheric propagation medium and radar 
reflectors in the target space were considered as sources of clutter-related 
noise, as discussed in the next section. 


THE SEARCH FOR SOURCES OF EXCESS NOISE IN THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT 

(U) After an introductory discussion of propagation geometry, this section 
gives brief descriptions of all the relevant experiments and tests, followed 
by discussions of postulated causes of noise due to reflection effects and 
propagation phenomena. 


PROPAGATION GEOMETRY

Figure 15 shows an idealized diagram of the propagation ray paths typical of 
radar operation using the ionosphere F-layer as the reflecting layer (the 
normal mode of operation). The rays emanating from the radar located at R are 
shown as being restricted to a range of elevation angles bounded by the lower 
ray path R-E3 and the upper ray path R-E1. In fact, of course, the actual 
elevation gain pattern did not have such sharp boundaries. It featured a 
direction of maximum gain that could be switched between an upper elevation 
angle of approximately 15 deg and a lower position of typically 5 to 7.5 deg 
by selecting, respectively, horizontal and vertical polarizations. The 
measured antenna patterns indicated considerable variations in elevation beam 
shape as a function of beam number and radar frequency.

     {(Figure classified Secret)} (U)

(U) The radiation pattern gain did approach zero at a zero elevation angle, 
due to horizon shielding, but there was considerable antenna gain at angles 
higher than the nominal upper limit of the beam represented by ray path R-E1. 
The effect of the high-angle radiation was not usually important, however, 
since these rays would normally pass through the F-layer end thus would not 
contribute to the normal OTH radar process. In Fig. 15, the highest ray that 
is reflected from, rather than penetrating, the F-layer is shown by the ray  
path R-F1-G1. This ray is shown as passing through the E-layer at points E2 
and E4. Similarly, the lowest ray follows the path R-F2-G2 and intersects the 
E-layer at E3 and E5. The ionospheric layers do not behave exactly as simple 
mirrors, as indicated in Fig. 15. The effective reflection heights, such as 
those of points F1 and F2, are a function of the radar frequency, the 
incidence angles of the radiation, and the ion density profile. Usually, at a 
fixed frequency the rays having the larger elevation angles at the radar will 
penetrate higher. Thus, point F1 would be slightly higher than F2. This 
phenomenon gives rise to a focusing effect, with the result that the 
effective gain of the antenna, when viewed looking back up the ray path from 
the region following the ionospheric reflection, is modified from that of the 
prereflection region. Usually, the effect is to increase the gain along rays 
in the region close to the uppermost ray (F1-G1). Figure 16 shows, along the 
abscissa, the relative time delays from the radar for reflections assumed to 
occur at the labeled points corresponding with the notation in Fig. 15. 

(U) The radar-range dependence of the observed amplitude of OTH ground 
clutter, as sketched in Fig. 16, may be accounted for as follows. On the 
radar side of point G1, no ground reflections are possible, because the 
ionosphere does not reflect the rays leaving the radar at elevation angles 
higher than that of R-F1. Moving from point G1 away from the radar, the 
ground reflections, as received back at the radar, build up in a particularly 
abrupt manner, since this is the region of enhanced gain due to the 
ionospheric focusing action. Beyond this point, the combined effects of 
increasing range, reducing antenna gain, and diminishing earth-grazing angle 
produce a rapid reduction in the received backscatter amplitude. For the 
depicted one-hop propagation mode, the ground backscattcr should effectively 
disappear at ranges greater than that appropriate to the point G2. 

DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS

Synoptic Measurements

(U) {(S)} During the approximately 18-month life of the AN/FPS-95, many 
observations were made and recorded in the form of notes, photographs, 
computer printouts, and magnetic tapes. Much of this information was relevant 
to the investigation of clutter-related noise. Unfortunately, these data were 
taken using a variety of radar operating parameters and analyzed by a number 
of different methods. The consequence was that the usefulness of the data for 
investigating the relationship between clutter-related noise and any single 
radar or operational parameter was impaired. 

(U) {(S)} To supplement the above data base, during the clutter-related noise 
investigation of the Scientific Assessment Committee, a concentrated synoptic 
data-gathering activity was conducted during February 1973 for a period of 19 
days.[31]  A daily schedule of 12 data-gathering runs was made on

each of beams 1, 7, and 12. During and beyond the duration of this test, 
local weather, solar flux, and the geomagnetic index were recorded to permit 
the investigation of possible correlation with clutter-related noise. The 
results of synoptic test data analysis clearly confirmed the persistent 
existence of the short-range, precursor, and clutter-related noises. They did 
not, however, reveal any clear correlation between the clutter related noise 
and local weather, solar, or geomagnetic parameters. 

(U) {(S)}  An interesting effect noted in data recorded between September 
1972 and May 1973 is that the ratio of ground clutter to clutter-related 
noise appeared to vary distinctly as a function of beam azimuth. The relative 
amount of noise was lowest in beam 1, rose gradually through beam 9, then 
dropped again until the most southerly beam 13 was reached. [32] The maximum 
variation (beam 1 to beam 9) was approximately 10 dB. 


Land/Sea Test [33]

(U) {(S)} The object of this test was to investigate the hypothesis that the 
clutter-related noise was generated, through the modulation and backscat 
tering of radar energy, by objects situated on or near the earth's surface, 
at ranges normally illuminated by the one-hop OTH radar propagation modes. 
Because of the importance of this experiment and its results, it is 
described in greater detail in the appendix at the end of this paper 

(U) {(S)} The test was arranged to measure the clutter-related noise powers 
from range-azimuth resolution cells within an area of AN/FPS-95 coverage 
encompassing both land and sea areas. The greatest variations in clutter-
related noise levels were found to occur between adjacent land and sea areas. 
These results were not inconsistent with the assumption that no clutter-
related noise was generated within the resolution cells located over the sea. 


Short-Range Noise Test [34]

(U) The primary purpose of this test was to identify the sources of the 
component of range related noise observed to occur at short radar ranges 
(less than approximately 600 nmi). The particular postulated mechanisms 
investigated were transmit/receive switch transients, transmitter-induced 
corona, antenna vibration, and meteor effects.

(U) Examination of off-line processed data showed effects were confined to 
extremely short radar ranges and that they could be ignored at the ranges of 
the observed short-range noise, Earlier in the AN/FPS-95 testing program, 
the presence of more serious switching transients had been observed using 
the on-line signal processor. These were subsequently reduced by an equipment 
modification. In this connection, it should be noted that the vast majority 
of data used in the investigations of range-related noise were analyzed by 
off-line techniques. 

(U) Although antenna arcing had previously been observed at lower radar 
operating frequencies, measurements at 2e MHZ, the frequency used for most 
short-range noise tests, failed to reveal any evidence of the phenomenon. 

(U) A measurement made at a frequency of 23 MHZ in beam 13 using vertical 
polarization contained a surface wave clutter signal at a range of 40 nmi. 
The amplitude of this signal was sufficiently higher than the noise 
background of the spectrally analyzed data to permit the conclusion that any 
spectral spreading of the signal (by antenna vibration) would be down by at 
least 66 dB. This conclusion does not, of course, necessarily exonerate the 
antenna at other frequencies, beam positions, and polarizations. 

(U) {(S)} The main effort in this test was devoted to an examination of the 
meteor theory of short-range noise generation. The noise was recorded in beam 
1 and beam 13 for each of the two available antenna polarizations (vertical 
and horizontal). Changing the polarization had the effect of raising the 
beam from a lower position to a higher position. The radar ranges of the 
recorded short-range noise were seen to shift in toward the radar when the 
beam was raised, in accordance with the hypothesis of backscattering 
occurring within the E-layer. The recorded data were used to calculate the 
antenna vertical beamshape for subsequent comparison with independent 
measured patterns. A good correspondence was thus obtained. The above 
measurements were performed both above and below the maximum usable frequency, 
at a frequency of 23 MHZ, by choosing the appropriate diurnal time. Some of 
the measurements, when operation was below the maximum usable frequency, 
were made at a low pulse repetition rate

(10 HZ). These latter data showed, incidentally, the typical appearance of 
precursor noise and clutter-related noise. 


Auroral Measurements

(U) As part of the planned experimental activity, a large quantity of data on 
the radio auroral effects was gathered during the life of the AN/FPS-95. This 
was taken from observations in the northerly beams (numbers 1 through 6).[12]  
In addition, the data recorded during the special synoptic investigation of 
clutter-related noise from beams 1, 7, and 12 were likewise examined for 
their auroral contributions. [12] 

(U) {(S)} Although the results showed that, particularly in the most 
northerly beams, auroral radar echoes could adversely affect the performance 
of the AN/FPS-95, there was no indication that these effects were related in 
any way to the clutter related noise, which by observation and definition, 
and in contrast to the auroral returns, always occurred at the same radar 
ranges as the earth surface backscatter. 


One-Way OTH Path Test [35,36] 

(U) {(S-NF)} Objectives of the One-Path Test were (1) to determine whether 
the spectrum of a known "clean" signal would be modified by effects 
associated with propagation via an ionospheric path and (2) to compare the 
signal received by various components of the AN/FPS-95 antenna (the antenna 
employed a ground screen thought to be a possible cause of clutter-related 
noise) with the signal received by specially constructed Yagi antenna. Aimed 
toward the Eastern Mediterranean, the antenna pattern resembled that of a 
single string of the AN/FPS-95 antenna. The Yagi had no ground screen. 

(U) {(S-NF)} In the tests, which were performed for the 6-day period from 
March 6 to 11, 1973, signals were transmitted by the AN/FPS-95 in England and 
received in the Eastern Mediterranean, and signals were transmitted by an HF 
site in the Eastern Mediterranean and received in England. During the period 
of the tests, the HF site transmitted for a 2-hr period from 10:00 a.m. to 
12:00 noon. The interval was broken up into eight 15-min periods, during each 
of which the transmitter at the HF site was turned off during the fifteenth 
minute to permit the receive antenna configuration at the AN/FPS-95 to be 
changed. The Yagi was used during the first and last 15-min periods; in 
between, combinations of the two strings of the AN/FPS-95 antenna that 
pointed toward the HF site in the Eastern Mediterranean were used so that 
comparisons could be made. During the following 2-hr period, from 12:00 noon 
to 2:00 p.m., the AN/FPS-95 transmitted and the signal was received in the 
Eastern Mediterranean by means of a gated receiver installed in a van located 
near the HF site. The dynamic range of the gated receiver and processor was 
80 dB or more. All one way tests were performed at 23.145 MHZ. 

(U) {(S-NF)} The shape of the spectrum of the signal received at the AN/FPS-
95 was essentially the same as that transmitted from the HF site at the same 
time. The spectrum was clean down to a level above 70 dB below the peak, at 
which point skirts formed; the average level of the skirts then fell off with 
frequency on either side of the carrier. Lines seen at a number of discrete 
frequencies in both local and over-the-horizon spectra were related to the 
power frequency and to blower frequencies. No evidence of any contamination 
by the ionosphere is present in the spectrum received at the AN/FPS-95, and 
no differences of consequence were seen between the spectra received by the 
several receive antenna configurations used at the AN/FPS-95, indicating that 
the ground screen of the system antenna was not contributing measurable 
noise. The spectrum of the AN/FPS-95 signal received at the HF site likewise 
was found free of noise down to the limit of dynamic range of the gated 
receiver, which was about 83 dB. 


Sporadic-E Layer/F-layer Test [37]

(U) {(S)} The objective of the Sporadic-E Layer/F-layer Test was to explore 
whether one layer or another of the ionosphere was the unique cause of the 
observed clutter-related noise. The test was made in connection with the 
Scientific Assessment Committee program in the early part of 1973 relative to 
the Synoptic Data Task (Task 7). 

(U) {(S)} The idea of the test was to compare the spectra of signal sequences 
that propagated via two-way sporadic-E refraction paths with the spectra of 
signal sequences that propagated simultaneously via two-way F-layer 
refraction paths. If the spectra of the signal sequence that propagated via

F-layer contained clutter-related noise and that via sporadic-E did not, then 
the F-layer is a possible unique cause of clutter-related noise could be 
inferred; if the signals that propagated via sporadic-E only had clutter-
related noise and the F-layer-only signals did not, then the F-layer would be 
absolved and sporadic-E implicated, and so on. Because sporadic-E layers were 
not in evidence during the time interval within which the Scientific 
Assessment Committee's investigation was conducted (February and March 1973), 
use was made of data recorded in June 1972 in connection with Design 
Verification System Testing (DVST) Experiment 202, when sporadic-E was a 
frequent occurrence. 

(U) {(S)} Analysis of the data showed clutter-related noise to be present in 
the Spectra of signal sequences that propagated over two-way sporadic-E 
propagation paths and in the spectra of signals that propagated 
simultaneously over two-way F-layer paths. The characters of the noise and 
the clutter-to-noise ratios were roughly the same in the two cases. 


Transmitter Power Reduction Test [25]

(U) {(S-NF)} Objective of the Transmitter Power Reduction Test which is 
relevant here was to determine whether the high power radiated by the 
transmitter was heating, and thus modifying, the ionosphere so as to cause 
the observed clutter related noise. 

(U) {(S-NF)} The test was done by members of the on-site staff on June 3, 
1972 with the radar in its normal operating configuration, transmitting in 
beam 7 on horizontal polarization at a frequency of 17.4 MHZ. All six 
transmitters were used. The transmitter power was reduced in steps of 3, 6, 
12, and 18 dB, each step being maintained for one minute, and all 
measurements were taken within about 5 min. In the data processing, range 
bins 80 nmi in range extent were formed, and the returns in each was 
coherently integrated for 6.4 sec. Further processing then yielded average 
noise power in all Doppler bins from PRF/8 to PRF/2 and the average clutter 
power in the first, eight Doppler bins around the carrier frequency. These 
averages were computed for each range bin during each integration interval. 

(U) {(S-NF)} The result relevant here is the behavior of average clutter 
power and average noise power in a range bin set near the peak of the ground 
backscatter. Here the clutter power and noise power increased together as 
transmitter power was decreased, but clutter and noise were only 10 to 12 dB 
down for the transmitter power reduction of 18 dB. (The experimenter 
conjectured that poor calibration of the power reduction switch could have 
caused the discrepancy.) There was no _sharp_ reduction in noise power at any 
point during transmitter power reduction. Both clutter power and noise power 
decreased smoothly and proportionately with transmitter power reduction. 


REFLECTION EFFECTS

(U) {(S-NF)} Postulated causes of range-related noise which attribute the 
phenomenon to equipment, local environment, or propagation effects generally 
include the assumption of the earth-surface reflection as an element of the 
relevant two-way radar propagation paths. This reflection is regarded as that 
of a fixed reflector, however, which does not therefore alter the spectral 
composition of the reflected energy from that of the incident energy. The 
spectral broadening that accounts for the clutter-related noise is assumed to 
occur elsewhere. In contrast, this section discusses postulated causes of 
range-related noise in which the spectral broadening of radiation, which is 
reflected back to the radar receiver from distant locations, occurs at the 
actual point of reflection, This reflection point may be in the normal 
ground-clutter reflection area or at some totally different location. 

(U) {(S-NF)} As described previously and as seen in Fig. 16, the range-
related noise was observed mainly in three well-defined regions of radar 
ranges, that is, a "short-range" region extending out to approximately 600 
nmi, a "precursor" region in front of the ground-clutter return, and a region 
coincident with the ground-clutter return. This latter noise is named 
"clutter-related noise," and it is the one of highest importance in its 
effect on the observation of most aircraft, since it is at the ranges of the 
ground clutter that the lower atmosphere is illuminated and, consequently, 
where the aircraft echoes are to be found. The other regions are also of some 
interest, however, since their noise may obscure the OTH observations of 
high-altitude targets such as ballistic missiles, as well as those of target 
echoes generated via multi-hop ambiguous-range propagation modes. Yet

another reason for investigating the origin of the close-in and precursor 
noise was the possibility that there may have been a single common cause for 
all of the observed excess noise. 


Postulated Reflective Causes of Range-Related Noise

(U) Possible explanations for the generation of range-related 
noise attributed to reflection mechanisms, together with the relevant 
observations that tend to support or disprove the theories, are listed in 
Table 7 and are discussed in the following paragraphs. A

Meteors 

(U) {(S)} It has long been known that meteors entering the lower ionosphere at 
heights of around 100 km produce ionization effects that reflect radio waves 
in the high frequency radio band. [38] Since these meteor-induced effects are 
transitory in nature and would therefore spread the spectrum of the incident 
radiation, they were obvious suspects as the cause of at least some of the 
range-related noise. Figures 15 and 16 show how the presence of the meteor 
reflections in the E-layer can give rise to the range-related noise 
identified as "short range" and "precursor."  The meteor effects would be 
distributed evenly through the E-layer, thus resulting in a precursor range-
related noise power vesus-range profile very similar in shape to that of the 
ground clutter, but reduced somewhat in range. Both theory and experiment 
have previously shown that the close-in and precursor range related noise 
should and does exist. [39,40]  Furthermore, the calculated and observed 
spectra of these features are shifted toward the recede direction, a fact 
that is in agreement with observations made with the AN/FPS-95. Figure 15, 
for clarity, exaggerates the vertical scale. In fact, the far tail of the 
precursor range-related noise would overlap the area G1-G2 occupied by the 
ground clutter and thus come under the definition of clutter-related noise. 
However, it would not give rise to a peak of noise within this region, as 
observed with the AN/FPS-95 and depicted in Fig. 16, and would not exhibit 
the symmetrical spectrum of the observed clutter-related noise. 

(U) {(S)} There were, and probably still are investigators who believe that 
the precursor noise and the clutter-related noise are one and the same 
phenomenon, This view is not shared by the authors of this paper. Strong 
credence was lent to the meteor explanation for the short-range noise by the 
results of the short-range noise experiment. [34]  Evidence for the meteor 
explanation of the precursor range-related noise was less well established. 
However, one of the radar displays features an A-scope representation of the 
envelope of raw radar return signals, on which could often be observed the 
characteristic decaying transient signals typical of radar echoes from the 
ionized columns caused by meteorites. These transients occurred at the same 
ranges as the precursor noise, and the two phenomena were therefore assumed 
to be connected. The results of the land/sea experiment are not compatible 
with a meteor explanation of clutter-releted noise, since it is

                    {SECRET NOFORN}      UNCLASSIFIED                    

highly unlikely that the meteor effects would exhibit abrupt differences in 
their reflection capabilities as a function of their geographical positions 
within the AN/FPS-95 coverage. 

(U) {(S)} To summarize, it appears that the clutter-related noise is a 
different phenomenon from the close-in end precursor range-related noise, 
both of which appear to be caused by reflections of radar energy from meteor-
induced ionization within the E layer. 


Auroral Effects (u) 

(U) The term "auroral" is a very loose description of the postulated causes 
of clutter-related noise considered under this heading. Such causes include 
all those which may be attributed to radar reflections from ionospheric 
irregularities, whether magnetic-field-aligned or otherwise. It happens that 
most of such well-known effects occur in the high latitudes and are somewhat 
loosely correlated in position with visible aurora. 

(U) {(S)} The radio aurora effects are known to produce radar reflections 
over a wide radio-frequency range, including the HF band. Furthermore, these 
reflections exhibit Doppler frequency shifts and spreading on the order of 
the observed clutter-related noise spectral widths. Over-the-horizon 
measurements in the Arctic have shown this "diffuse spectrum clutter" as a 
severe limitation to the detection of aircraft. [41] Also, the ranges from 
the AN/FPS-95 to the zone of maximum auroral activity were such as to place 
the radar ranges of the auroral reflections within the AN/FPS-95 coverage. 

(U) {(S)} Much information was gathered throughout the operational life of 
the AN/FPS-95 on the radar returns from radio aurora. [12] In addition, more 
of these data were specifically gathered as part of the synoptic data 
collection during the investigation of clutter-related noise. These data 
clearly distinguished auroral effects from those of clutter-related noise in 
a number of particulars. First, the auroral returns, while occasionally 
coinciding in range with those of ground clutter, were generally to be found 
at ranges and with statistical frequencies that varied considerably, 
depending upon the time of observation, season, magnetic activity, operating 
frequency, and azimuth. Second, the spectra of the auroral backscatter were 
generally highly asymmetrical. And third, the amplitudes of the returns were 
found to depend strongly upon the radar frequency, being 10 to 30 dB higher 
at 8 MHZ than at 10 MHZ. 

(U) {(S)} These observed characteristics of radio aurora reflections contrast 
strongly with characteristics of clutter-related noise, which include 
gradual variations in level as a function of beam azimuth and radar 
frequency, symmetrical spectra, and a close correlation in range with that of 
the ground clutter. 


Aircraft Returns

(U) {(S)} Among the less plausible suggested causes of clutter-related noise 
was the possibility that the reflections from a large number of aircraft, 
entering the radar receiver through the antenna sidelobes, could be the 
source. It would be ironic indeed if the AN/FPS-95 failed to see aircraft 
because it was seeing too many aircraft! Quantitative calculations to 
examine this postulated phenomenon have not been performed, largely because 
of a lack of data concerning the numbers, velocities, and dispositions of 
aircraft about the radar. It does, however, seem extremely unlikely that 
within a given range cell, even within a large azimuth sector, there would 
have been sufficient aircraft to occupy all the Doppler cells (typically 
several hundred) and, thus, have given the appearance of broadband noise. 
Even if this had been the case, then the relatively small number of 
aircraft within the antenna mainlobe should have been separately resolvable 
in Doppler frequency and would, on account of the large two-way gain 
differential relative to the sidelobes, have been easily discerned above the 
clutter-related noise background. One would also have expected to see marked 
diurnal changes in the noise due to the reduction in air activity at night. 

 
Earth Surface Effects

(U) {(S)} While there are virtually no objects on the earth or sea surface 
which have translatory velocities comparable with those of aircraft and which 
might therefore produce Doppler-shifted radar reflections to interfere with 
OTH aircraft detection, there are nevertheless many objects, particularly 
man-made, that move, vibrate, or rotate in such a manner as to modulate an 
incident radio wave, either in phase or amplitude, so as to generate 
sidebands in the reflected power. These sidebands could, if removed 
sufficiently in fre-

 ===========================================================================

     UNCLASSIFIED           {SECRET NORFORN}          

quency from that of the incident power, resemble clutter-related noise. 
Within a single AN/FPS-95 range-azimuth resolution cell (an area of 
approximately 10,000 nmi^2 for a 1-msec pulse at a range of 1,000 nmi) 
practically anywhere within eastern Europe, one would expect to find a large 
number of potential modulating reflectors, such as vibrating telephone wires, 
fences and power lines, rotating wheels, and moving vehicles which, either 
alone or through interaction with surrounding terrain or structures, would 
present time-modulated reflective properties. Qualitatively at least, it is 
plausible that such an ensemble of modulating entities could spread the 
spectrum of the incident radar energy to produce the clutter-related noise 
phenomenon. The assumption that these effects ere spread evenly throughout 
the AN/FPS-95 coverage would suffice to explain the observed correlation 
between the amplitude-versus-range behavior of the clutter-related noise and 
that of the ground clutter. 

(U) {(S)} Another modulation effect could be generated by stationary 
reflecting objects, composed of sections between which the electrical 
impedance is varying. For example, the metal frameworks of buildings may be 
composed of sections that are poorly connected electrically. A mechanical 
vibration could cause such a connection to vary in impedance and thus produce 
a reflection with sidebands at the vibration frequency and its harmonics. 
Indeed, such an effect was used to calibrate the AN/FPS-95. The devices in 
question were located in Norway and Turkey and consisted of log-periodic 
antennas, pointing toward the radar, whose terminals were connected to 
modulated impedances. The reflected power from these switched reflectors, 
with its characteristic modulation frequency, could be detected and 
identified at the AN/FPS-95. It is possible to imagine many man-made 
artifacts that might conceivably contain such modulated impedances, including 
wire fences, vehicles, and even railroad tracks whose sections are connected 
by impedances that could vary rapidly during the passage of a train across 
the joints. 

(U) {(S)} A third modulating agency, somewhat similar to that just described, 
involves the existence of nonlinear electrical impedances within the 
reflecting bodies. Such impedances, when exposed to local time-varying 
electrical fields, would also have the effect of modulating the reflections 
of incident radar energy, and thus have the potential for generating 
clutter-related noise. 

(U) {(S)} Finally, it should be noted that the effects described here need 
not necessarily be limited to man-made reflecting bodies. Intuitively, 
however, the observed motions of natural objects such as vegetation would 
lead one to expect a spectral distribution of reflected energy that would 
peak up toward the low Doppler frequencies, in contrast to the broad, flat 
characteristics of the observed clutter-related noise. 

(U) {(S)} There is no doubt that the effects described in this section do 
exist. Investigations have aimed at using such effects for the radar 
identification of man-made objects. [42]  Whether the effects are 
quantitatively consistent with being the source of the clutter-related noise 
observed with the AN/FPS-95 is, however, not known. 

(U) {(S)} In order to test the hypothesis that clutter-related noise was 
generated by earth-surface effects, such as those just described, the 
Land/Sea Experiment was performed. This experiment was designed to identify 
the existence, if any, of persistent differences in the clutter-related noise 
levels from geographically separate areas of the AN/FPS-95 coverage. In 
particular, the experiment was designed to include a comparison of land and 
sea areas, since such a comparison should reveal large differences in 
clutter-related noise if the clutter-related noise was generated by man-made 
artifacts. The results of the experiment (see Appendix) were consistent with 
the theory that little, if any, of the clutter-related noise was generated by 
reflections from the sea areas, when compared with that from the land areas. 
In contrast, the clutter levels returned from the sea areas were roughly 
similar in power to those from the land areas. These two facts support the 
hypothesis that the clutter-related noise is generated by some reflection 
mechanisms operating within the land areas of the AN/FPS-95 coverage, and is 
not caused by spectral spreading of the radar energy occurring either before 
or after reflection at the land or sea surface. 


Multihop Effects

(U) {(S)} It is known that, as expected, the effect of a rising or falling 
ionospheric layer is to shift the frequency o radiation reflected from the 
layer. It

was therefore suggested that the radar energy arriving back at the receiver, 
after many such reflections from multihop propagation modes, might be a cause 
of clutter-related noise. 

(U) {(S)} One reason that this would seem to be unlikely is that such 
multihop returns would not generally coincide in range with that of the 
observed clutter-related noise, which is always approximately coincident 
with the ground clutter. Another reason concerns the fact that the observed 
single-hop Doppler shift due to rising or falling ionospheric layers is 
usually less than 1 Hz. Since the amplitudes of the returns from 
successively higher orders of hop would generally be attenuated, one would 
expect the corresponding spectrum to fall off sharply with frequency. It 
would also be rare to encounter the particular mix of rising and falling 
layers necessary to account for a symmetrical spectrum. From this reasoning, 
it appears unlikely that multihop effects could explain clutter-related 
noise: This conclusion is strengthened by the low PRF observations performed 
during the short-range noise experiment, [34] wherein clutter-related noise 
was observed during radar operation at a PRF of 10 HZ.


PROPAGATION MEDIUM EFFECTS

(U) The spectra of high-frequency radar signals could be corrupted by a 
number of mechanisms in passing from the radar antenna over the horizon to 
the earth's surface. It is the dual purpose of this section first to list the 
various phenomena that have been postulated as possible mechanisms for such 
spectral corruption and then to review the evidence for and against each case 
as the cause of observed clutter-related noise. Here we consider only 
_transmission_ effects; _reflection_ effects are dealt with in the preceding 
section. 

(U) {(S)} The matrix of Table 8 lists at the left specific phenomena that 
have been put forward as possible causes in the transmission medium for 
clutter related noise. Across the top are the names of various experiments 
that were performed to confirm or deny one or more of the causes. Check marks 
(X's) signify which experiments relate to the various postulated causes. The 
method here will be to consider each phenomenon in turn and to review for 
each the relevant experimental evidence that was generated in the attempts 
to find and eliminate the cause of the noise. 


F-Layer Vertical Motion and Waves

(U) {(S-NF)} The Experiments which bear on the F-layer of the ionosphere as 
the unique cause of clutter-related noise are the One-Way Path Tests, [35,36] 
the Sporadic E-Layer/F-Layer Experiment, [37] and 

{SECRET NOFORN}                         UNCLASSIFIED               JDR 321

 ===========================================================================

     UNCLASSIFIED           {SECRET NORFORN}          

the Land/Sea Test. [33] These tests are described earlier in this section. 

(U) {(S-NF)} One-Way Path Tests, which consisted of transmissions both ways 
between England and the Eastern Mediterranean via F-layer refraction, 
showed no contamination of spectra induced by the medium down to the 
dynamic-range limits of the measuring equipment to excess of 80 dB. About 
the only ionospheric effects noted were simple spectral shifts of 1 to 2 HZ 
caused by ionospheric vertical motion. 

(U) {(S)} In the E-Layer/F-Layer test, ground clutter returns via one-hop 
sporadic-E and one-hop F-layer propagation modes were observed and analyzed. 
Clutter-related noise was observed on both sporadic E- and F-mode returns. 
The characters of the noise and the clutter-to-clutter-related noise ratios 
in the two cases were essentially the same. 

(U) {(S)} Finally, the result of the Land/Sea Backscatter Test showed that 
the clutter-related noise associated with the clutter return from sea 
surfaces was significantly less than that associated with clutter returns 
from land surfaces at the same range and in adjacent beams. A mechanism in 
the F-region that can create the spectral contamination at different levels 
relative to the clutter for land and sea reflection surfaces is difficult to 
conceive. 


E-Layer and Sporadic-E Vertical Motion and Waves

(U) {(S)} Remarks along the lines of those given for the F-layer above relate 
also to the E-layer as the possible unique source of the contamination (that 
is, clutter-related noise) of the clutter spectrum when the clutter return 
passes through or is refracted by the E-layer of the ionosphere. One 
significant point is that clutter-related noise was always observed, even at 
night when the E-layer did not exist, whenever propagation support was strong 
enough to raise the clutter returns to 70 dB or so above natural background 
noise. And again, the Land/Sea Test [33] seems to rule out the propagation 
medium ns a whole as the source of clutter related noise. 


Ionospheric Modification and Heating

(U) {(S-NF)} It has been conjectured that the observed clutter-related noise 
could result from the heating of the ionosphere caused by high power of the 
transmitted signal.  Ionospheric heating calculations, [20,43,44] the 
Transmitter Power Reduction Test, [23] and the One-Way Path Tests [35,36] 
relate to this possible cause, as do the Land/Sea Tests. [33]

(U) {(S)} Calculations predict (1) that, at the power levels associated with 
the AN/FPS-95 and for low-angle transmitted rays, caustics will occur at 
approximately E-region heights following F-layer refraction, (2) that the 
ionosphere will be heated in the region of the caustic, and (3) that the, 
spectrum of the radar signal will be distorted. The distortion, calculations 
show, should result in an asymmetric broadening of the central line of the 
radar signal spectrum on the recede-Doppler side. The amount of the 
broadening predicted is about 2 HZ. Ionospheric heating would _not_, 
according to calculations, account for the approximately flat amplitude 
excess noise (that is, the so-called clutter-related noise) that fills the 
entire unambiguous Doppler-frequency region. 

(U) {(S)} Further, any effect caused by ionospheric heating should change 
with power level, and changes in the level of clutter-related noise with 
respect to that of the clutter or in the character of clutter-related noise 
(for example, the spectral shape) with transmitter power level were never 
observed, either in ordinary day-to-day operation or in the Transmitter Power 
Reduction Tests. As before, the results of the Land/Sea Tests imply that 
clutter-related noise is not caused by ionospheric heating or, indeed, by 
any effect in the propagation medium. 


Meteor-Induced Power-Flow Modulation

(U) {(S)} Some attempts have been made to relate both backscattering and 
forward scattering from the so-called "meteor belt" located about 100 km 
above the earth with the observed clutter-related noise. All over-the-horizon 
backscatter signals pass through the meteor belt four times, and the forward 
power flow of the signal conceivably could be modulated by interaction with 
meteors to create the clutter-related noise. The experiments relevant to 
possible meteor-induced power flow modulation as a cause of clutter-related 
noise are the One-Way Path Test [35,36) and the Land/Sea Test. [33]

(U) {(S)} In regard to the One-Way Path Test, none of the results supported 
the hypothesis that the meteor belt corrupted in a measurable way the 
spectrum of the forward-scattered signal. During

reception of the AN/FPS-95 signal in the Eastern Mediterranean, we looked for 
meteor-belt-induced forward scatter by slewing the range gate ahead of and 
behind the main received radar pulse. Results were inconclusive, perhaps 
because of a lack of adequate isolation of the gate. But the spectrum of the 
received direct signal was not measurably corrupted in any way. As before, 
the Land/Sea Test results imply that the cause of clutter-related noise is 
not in the transmission medium. 


Aurora Power Flow-Modulation

(U) {(S)} The question here is whether the cause of the observed clutter-
related noise could be a modulation of the signal resulting from interaction 
with aurora as the signal passed through the propagation medium. 

(U) {(S)} To cause spread-frequency noise (that is, noise resembling clutter-
related noise) to be present in range intervals containing returns reflected 
from the earth's surface, either the main signal would have to be corrupted 
in passing through aurora-disturbed regions or the corruption would have to 
be impressed upon non-main-path signal components (that is, transmissions of 
the signal over paths containing aurora in the antenna sidelobe direction, 
and so on) that arrived back at the radar receiver at times corresponding to 
those of the arrival of the main-path clutter returns. For the former - 
corruption of the main signal by passage through auroral regions - 
transmissions would have to be along certain beams, namely, the more 
northerly beams, and at times when aurora was present. One would then expect 
the clutter related noise to occur in northerly beams only when aurora was 
present. But clutter-related noise was present with clutter returns from 
northerly beams whether aurora was present or not. [12] In fact, clutter-
related noise was observed in returns via all beams, including southerly 
beams, whether aurora was present in the north or not. In regard to the 
conjecture that aurora-induced noise entered through the sidelobes of the 
antenna, studies [12] that analyzed the return in each beam as a function of 
time, range, and magnetic activity made it possible to distinguish and 
categorize auroral clutter. The studios also found, at times and for some 
beams, that auroral clutter could increase the noise level in the range bins 
containing ground clutter, but that _mostly_ it would not. [12] 


FEASIBILITY OF ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES AS THE SOURCE OF EXCESS NOISE

(U) {(S)} In the absence of any convincing conventional explanation for the 
clutter-related noise, some speculated that the noise could have been 
generated deliberately. After all, the AN/FPS-95 was engaged in a 
surveillance of the Soviet Union and the Soviet-Bloc countries, a function 
that could have been deeply resented. Perhaps this resentment provoked 
countermeasures to reduce the radar's effectiveness and ultimately remove it 
from the scene. Admittedly, the notion seems "far fetched"; however, it is 
not easily disposed of and remains a possible explanation for the noise. In 
this section, we explore this possibility and describe how it could have been 
done. 

(U) {(S)} If countermeasures were employed, they were not of the conventional 
jamming type, because jamming in the ordinary sense would have been observed 
by the site personnel. Furthermore, such jamming would have both violated 
international agreements and incurred severe criticism. But a jamming 
technique not easily recognized as jamming might be a distinct possibility. 
Granted that the notion of "covert jamming" seems even more ridiculous, it 
is, however, not without precedent. There is a technique referred to by some 
as "Villard's Disclosure" that provides a basis for covert jamming in OTH 
systems.*  Over-the-horizon radars generally have large transmitting antennas 
and high-power transmitters, which combine to produce large power densities 
in the target coverage area. The actual return from the targets of interest 
is quite small compared with the incoming radiation and its scattered 
components from ground clutter. These target returns are detectable at the 
radar because OTH radar has a large receiving aperture; in the target 
coverage area, however, the target returns tend to be masked or covered by 
the large incoming and ground-scattered signals. In other locations, it is 
also difficult to discern the signals reflected from the target because of 
the large clutter return that covers the signal. These clutter returns are 
also present at the radar, but are removed by compli-

years ago, but the authors do not have a reference to support this 
conjecture.

cated Doppler processing equipment that separates target returns from clutter 
returns on the basis of their motion. Suppose, then, that an adversary 
generated a signal in the target area that is proportional to the radar 
illumination and somewhat larger than the returns from a legitimate target,

signal spreads across the spectrum to fill both the unambiguous Doppler band 
and the illuminated range interval. The world at large would never see this 
jamming signal because, as a rule, ordinary antennas are small and no 
equipment is available to separate the jamming from the covering clutter 
return. At the OTH radar, though, the signal would not only be visible, but 
would also mask the targets of interest. It would, in fact, exhibit all the 
properties of clutter-related noise, triggering in turn a some what 
predictable chain of events. The first reaction would be that, since the 
clutter return was not fully cancelled, something must be wrong with the 
radar. If we found the radar to be fault-free, we would blame the ionosphere. 
If we exonerated the ionosphere, we would blame the clutter. In the end, we 
would lose patience and summarily cancel the program without ever discovering 
the cause. This is indeed covert jamming. 

(U) {(S)} At this point, we will briefly describe how this jamming technique 
could be implemented.  There are of course many ways, but we describe only 
one. 

(U) {(S)} The radar coverage of the AN/FPS-95 was a region spanning 
approximately 90 deg In azimuth and from 500 to 2,000 nmi in range from 
Orford Ness, England. Select 15 sites in this region, any where in azimuth 
but separated by 100 nmi in range. At each site, install a linear array of 
16 monopoles with a backscreen boresighted on Orford Ness. (Such an antenna 
has been built at MITRE for a cost of about $25,000, and it has a gain of 25 
dB.) Each site would be equipped to recognize the AN/FPS-95 signal by its 
power, pulse width, PRF, and direction of arrival. (One element of the array 
could be used for a sidelobe cancellation device.) Each site would also be 
provided with a linear transmitter that would, upon the reception of the 
AN/FPS-95 signal, repeat its signal offset in frequency and in every Doppler 
cell and in every range cell for 100 nmi trailing the range of the site. 
Each site that was illuminated would in turn fill its portion of the total 
area illuminated by the AN/FPS-95. The 100-nmi uncertainty at the beginning 
and end would hardly be noticed. Each site would sense its being either in a 
sidelobe or the main beam of the AN/FPS-95 and adjust the level of its 
transmitted signal to exceed that of legitimate radar targets by 10 dB, 
taking into account sidelobe/main-beam receiving gains of the AN/FPS-9 By 
and large (12 out of 13 times), the site would be working into the AN/FPS-
95 sidelobes, but when the main beam happened on the site, it would attenuate 
its normal transmission by about 20 dB. The power requirement can be 
determined es follows : Let 

    S   =   signal power received from a target,
    J   =   Signal power received from a jamming site per resolution cell,
    P   =   average power of the radar,
    p   =   average power of the jammer per resolution cell,
    G   =   gain of the radar antenna,
    g   =   gain of the jammer antenna,
    A   =   receiving aperture of the radar,
    s   =   sidelobe level of the radar antenna below the main-beam gain, 
    X   =   radar cross section of the target ,
    R   =   range to the target from the radar,
    r   =   range to the jammer from the radar,
    L   =   radar propagation losses, and
    l   =   jammer propagation losses.

then p = 2.78X10^-4 watts/resolution cell.

(U) {(S)} Since the shortest pulse used on the AN/FPS-95 was 250 microsec 
long, corresponding to 20 nmi in range, each jammer must fill no more than 
five range cells. Since trailing cells require less power than the first 
cell, the power requirement due to range cells is less than five times the 
power requirement for the first cell. The highest PRF of the AN/FPS-95 was 
160 Hz, and with 10 sec of integration, there are no more than 1,600 Doppler 
resolution cells. Consequently, there are less than 8,000 resolution cells 
in total, and the worst-case jammer at 500 nmi would require less than 2.22 
watts. A site at 2,000 nmi would require 1/256 of this power. In either case, 
the jammer power requirements are quite small. 

(U) {(S)} We are forced to conclude that the jamming technique is quite 
feasible, and is not clear that the experiments conducted at the AN/FPS-95 
would have discovered the jamming had it occurred. If experiments confirming 
or denying the possibility had been conducted, they would have perhaps 
resolved the issue. They were not conducted. 


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

(U) {(S)} The AN/FPS-95 OTH radar built by the U.S. Air Force on the north 
Sea Coast of England in the late 1960's was plagued by noise that severely 
limited subclutter visibility and, thus, seriously impaired the detection 
performance of the radar. All-out attempts to locate and correct the source 
of the noise in the relatively brief time allotted in late 1972 and early 
1973 were unsuccessful: The source was not found. Subsequently, the program 
was terminated abruptly on June 30, 1973, after which the radar was 
dismantled and its components removed from the site. 

(U) {(S)} A host of tests were performed on the radar equipment to see if it 
contained the source of the noise. In the end, the equipment was exonerated; 
furnished by RCA Corp., Moorestown, N.J., it was generally of high quality 
and was judged as almost certainly _not_ the source of the clutter related 
noise. 

(U) {(S)} Tests on the environment external to the radar seem to eliminate as 
causes of the noise all effects except what we have called earth-reflection 
effects. While the results of the Land/Sea Test, which explored the earth-
reflection effects, are generally consistent with the hypothesis that 
clutter-related noise is present in returns from land surfaces and not 
present in returns from sea surfaces, the evidence is too limited, both in 
time and in regions examined, to be considered conclusive. 

(U) {(S)} As this paper suggests, a few inexpensive simple, repeater-type 
jammers with a few watts of power output each, distributed over the radar 
coverage zone, conceivably could have produced effects like those identified 
in the paper as clutter related noise. No tests performed at the radar either 
confirm or deny the hypothesis that jamming caused the clutter-related noise. 

(U) {(S)} The strange legacy of the AN/FPS-95 is the enigma surrounding the 
clutter-related noise. In all the time since the program terminated, the 
radar community - even including some OTH radar specialists - does not seem 
to have assimilated either the nature of the difficulty that beset the AN/FPS-
95 or the details of the program that was mounted to try to find the cause. 
There seems to be a feeling that the Cobra Mist experience was anomalous and 
that the affliction will not recur. The authors would caution against such a 
view. 

(U) {(S)} The AN/FPS-95 experience may indicate that natural effects of some 
kind limit the subclutter visibility achievable in high-frequency OTH radars 
to about 60 to 70 dB. The AN/FPS-95 was the first OTH radar with enough power 
routinely to generate clutter returns 80 to 90 dB above external CCIR noise 
levels. Therefore, it is perhaps the first OTH radar to be afflicted 
routinely with clutter-related noise. But not the only one: During the Cobra 
Mist tests in 1973, members of the Scientific Assessment Committee visited 
another OTH radar site, bringing back data records that clearly showed noise 
resembling clutter-related noise in range bins containing ground-clutter 
returns. [7] So, at least in 1973, clutter-related noise was observed at 
another OTH radar. 

(U) {(S)} If the cause of clutter-related noise is an area effect and some 
believe that it is - it can be overcome in design by giving an OTH radar 
adequate spatial resolution, so that the returns from

objects that the radar is to detect appear at levels well above the AN/FPS-95 
observed clutter related noise level. One might require, for example, that 
the spatial resolution of an OTH radar be such that the amplitude of returns 
from targets of interest be within about 40 to 50 dB of the earth clutter 
return. Moreover, regarding countermeasures, designers of future OTH radars, 
conceived to overlook the land area of an adversary, should remember that an 
OTH radar like the AN/FPS-95 would be relatively easy to jam and that the 
jamming would be difficult to detect. 

(U) {(S)} It is the hope the authors that this paper will Stimulate informed 
discussion and debate about the cause, or causes, of clutter-related noise. 
The clutter-related noise anomaly should be pursued: Resolution of such 
anomalies almost always is accompanied by a significant advance in knowledge 
and understanding. 

APPENDIX: THE LAND/SEA EXPERIMENT [33]

(U) {(S)} The objective of this experiment was to determine whether or not 
there were persistent differences between the levels of clutter-related noise 
within a range-azimuth resolution cell as a function of the geographic 
position of the cell. In particular, it was desired to compare those cells 
located over land with those over water. 

(U) {(S)} Conceptually, the ideal way to carry out the comparison would be to 
hold all the other relevant radar parameters constant during the measurement 
and to varying the geographical area within the resolution cell. Since this 
was obviously impossible, the experiment was designed to minimize, as far as 
possible, the differences in these parameters while alternating between the 
two measurements. This was achieved by comparing only pairs of resolution 
cells that were close together, that is, at the same ranges, but in adjacent 
azimuth beam positions, It was judged that this method would be superior to 
that of comparing adjacent range resolution cells within one beam, because 
the noise was known to be highly range dependent and also because the 
absolute position in range of the cells was subject to some uncertainty 
because of ionospheric layer height uncertainties. As the two resolution 
cells were at the same range and adjacent, the respective radar propagation 
paths would have very similar vertical profiles (assuming a well-behaved 
ionosphere), and the take-off angles at the antenna - and by implication, the 
relative gains - would likewise be similar. The effect of temporal variations 
in the clutter-related noise during the cell-pair comparisons was minimized 
by making the second cell measurement immediately after the first and then 
averaging a large number of such measurements. Possible differences between 
the antenna gains at adjacent azimuth beam positions would be revealed by a 
comparison of surface-clutter returns in those areas where the two beams both 
straddled areas of similar surface, that is, both land or both sea. It was 
hoped that gain differences would be small, since five of the six antenna 
strings were common between adjacent beams. Many measurements were spread 
throughout the diurnal cycle. This had the incidental effect of requiring a 
range of radar operating frequency to accommodate different ionospheric 
conditions, which consequently produced differences in the take-off angles of 
the radiation from the antenna. It should be emphasized, however, that during 
any single comparison measurement between adjacent resolution cells, the 
frequency was held constant. The diversity in frequency and elevation take-
off angle was not considered detrimental, since it would tend to smear out 
any possible (although unlikely) antenna effects that might conceivably 
generate clutter-related noise over a very small range of elevation angles 
more in one beam than in the adjacent beam. Since this effect would have 
resulted in a persistent variation of clutter-related noise as a function of 
azimuth and range, it could have led to a misinterpretation of the 
experimental results. 


Area of Observation

(U) {(S)} The area selected for observation was bounded by beams 9 and 13, 
inclusively, and by ground ranges of 1,000 and 1,500 nmi (Fig. 17). It was 
chosen mainly or the reason that it contained a large portion of the Black 
Sea and had the requisite land/sea boundaries between azimuth beam positions. 
Additionally, the area's terrain features and industrialization levels varied 
widely. Another important consideration was that the chosen radar ranges 
should not allow single-hop E-layer propagation modes, with consequent 
confusion between these modes and the normal one-hop F-modes.

The beam positions on Fig. 17 correspond to the nominal azimuth directions 
of the AN/FPS-95 antenna structure. The radial lines indicate the nominal 
one-way half-power bearings of each beam. Measurements of the actual 
antenna patterns [43] revealed that the beam positions squinted inward, so 
that the high-number beams were actually pointing several degrees north of 
their nominal positions. This fact is important in the interpretation of 
the experimental data. The range-resolution cells drawn in beam 12 are each 
40 nmi long. Reference to these cells is by the numbers indicated in the 
figure. 

Operating Parameters and Procedures

(U) During data gathering, the AN/FPS-5 was operated using the following 
parameters: 

    Frequency:             Variable 
    Pulse length:          500 microsec 
    Pulse shape :          Cosine-squared 
    PRF:                   40 pulses/sec 
    Antenna polarization:  Horizontal 
    Beam numbers:          13, 12, 11, 10, and 9 

(U) For each run, the data were recorded first in beam 13 for 2 min. Beam 12 
was then similarly treated, and so on down to beam 9. The 10 min of data thus 
recorded on magnetic tape were all taken using a single radar frequency. 
Subsequent 10 min runs would not necessarily be at the same frequency. Over 
the course of the experiment, approximately 8 hr of data were recorded and 
analyzed. 


Data Analysis

(U) {(S)} A full description of the signal and data analysis is beyond the 
scope of this paper, and the interested reader is referred to Ref. 33. 
Briefly, however, for each range cell the 2 min sequence of signal returns 
was divided into batches of 3.2.sec duration (128 samples) and submitted to 
an off line spectral analysis. This permitted the ground or sea-clutter 
returns, which are located in the vicinity of zero Doppler shift, to be 
separated from the clutter-related noise. Measurement of total clutter power 
was made in a Doppler band extending from +5 HZ to -5 HZ. Clutter-related

noise was measured in a frequency band extending from +5 Hz to +15 Hz. The 
measurements of ground or sea clutter and of the clutter-related noise that 
were thus produced for all of the 3.2-sec intervals within a 2-min recording 
were averaged to obtain smoothed estimates. These estimates were then paired 
with similar estimates obtained from the same range cell in the adjacent 
azimuth beam, which were obtained from measurements made 2 min after those of 
the first beam. From these pairs was calculated the fraction of the total, 
clutter or clutter-related noise in each pair of resolution cells 
attributable to each member of the azimuth beam pair. The fractions thus 
calculated were further averaged over all of the valid 2-min recordings. The 
number of fractions thus averaged varied from cell-pair to cell-pair and 
between clutter and clutter-related noise due to the application of data-
validation algorithms. After rejecting invalid data, the number of fractions 
averaged ranged from a low of 18 to a high of 46, each representing 2 min of 
raw recorded data. 


Results 

(U) {(S)} The results of the experiment are tabulated in Tables 9 and 10 for 
the clutter-related noise and clutter, respectively. The interpretation of 
these tables is best explained by means of an example. Referring to Table 9, 
the letters L and S indicate whether a particular resolution cell was 
predominantly on land or on sea. Consider range cell 32 and the line 
separating beam 11 from beam 12. The numbers 81 and 19 will be found 
straddling this line. This means that the noise powers observed in beam 11, 
range cell 32, and in beam 12, range cell 32 were measured to be in the ratio 
of 81 to 19. 


Interpretation of Results 

(U) {(S)} Examination of Fig. 17 shows that two of the resolution cells in 
beam 12 (cells 33 and 34) are completely over the water out to and beyond the 
half-power one-way beamwidth points. If it is assumed that the clutter-
related noise is returned only from land areas, then an integration of the 
two-way beam pattern across, and well beyond, the half-power one-way 
beamwidth would produce the conclusion that the ratios of clutter-related 
noise in beam 11, range cells 33 and 34, to that in beam 12, range cells 33 
and 34, should be much larger than indicated in Table 9. However, as 
mentioned previously, the actual high-number beam positions, as measured 
during limited airborne antenna pattern calibrations, were skewed around 
toward the north by amounts ranging roughly from 3 deg to 7 deg. With such 
beam shifts, the land on the northern side of the Black Sea would be 
positioned in the skirts of beam 12,

thereby increasing the amount of clutter-related noise received in that 
beam. A numerical integration of the two-way antenna pattern for various 
assumed beam skews shows the following results for the expected ratios of 
clutter-related noise in beam 11 to that in beam 12 at the ranges of range 
cells 33 and 34. 

      Assumed Northerly
          skew (deg)      CRN Ratio

              0              28:1
              3               7:1
              5               2:1

(U) {(S)} This clutter-related noise ratios are seen to be not inconsistent 
with the ratios of 87:13 and 82:18 from Table 9, assuming existing beam skews 
of approximately 3 to 4 deg, which is within the range of the measured beam 
skews. 

(U) {(S)} From the preceding arguments, it appears that the experimental 
measurements of clutter-related noise are fully consistent with the 
hypothesis that little, if any, clutter-related noise is returned from 
resolution cells corresponding to sea areas when compared with clutter-
related noise returned from land cells. As Table 9 shows, the clutter-related 
noise variation between either adjacent pairs of land cells or an adjacent 
sea cell pair is generally much smaller than that observed at land/sea 
boundaries. The data in Table 10 for clutter returns are particularly 
interesting when compared with the clutter-related noise data in Table 9, for 
they show that at the land/sea boundaries, and unlike the clutter-related 
noise behavior, the clutter levels do not change appreciably. These facts do 
not support theories of clutter-related noise generation that propose that 
the radar energy is modulated during propagation to form clutter related 
noise either before or after being scattered back from the land or sea 
surface. If such were the case, there would be little difference between the 
clutter-related noise returned from the land areas and that from adjacent sea 
areas.
