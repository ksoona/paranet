			STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
Obscure Research Labs is the world's only organization devoted to the 
acquisition of Total Knowledge, in order to obtain the clearest idea
of Just What's Going On.  While other research organizations bother and
fuss about specific solutions for specific problems, only ORL dares to
intergrate all that is known, suspected or believed into one all-inclusive
Explanation:  "Y o u   n e v e r   c a n   t e l l . . ."


			AREAS OF SPECIAL STUDY

Although our Research takes us into every conceivable realm of experience,
there are a few subjects to which we return for the sharp relief into which 
they throw everything else, to wit:

	-- UFOs:  Some people say that UFOs cannot be proven to exist.
While that may or may not be so , it cannot be argued that the "belief"
in UFOs exists and on a large scale.  We leave it to others to record
and investigate the odd sighting or abduction, prefering to concentrate
on the social aspects of the phenomeon; for it is within the study of 
such things that we find a perfect model of the brain's adaptation to
the inexplicable.

	-- TIME TRAVEL:  When you set out to learn all is learnable, it
can be frustrating to be limited by your own time.  We at Obscure Research
Labs have managed to overcome this limitation and as a result we are able
to obtain Inside Scoops that conventional scientists would trade 
Ramapithecus' eye teeth for.

	-- PARAPHYSICS:  Similar to paramedics, but much, much smaller.
Enables us to "patch" quantum events and make possible

	-- MATRIX TECHNOLOGY:  These are the tools we use to acess the 
more exciting parts of Reality.  They include the Channeltron (a sort of
ethereal radio set) and the Subdimensional TransAnachreator (a somewhat
limited time-machine/eigenstate-hopper, which utilizes Dr. Elder's 
discovery (and subsequent exploitation) of the Matrix (which see).

	-- DISINFORMATION TRACKING:  The study of hoaxes and the like;
especially the followings they engender (cults, religions,social movements,
etc.) as a result of widespread belief.



			WHAT IS THE MATRIX???


                                      _______ You
                                     /
                                    /  ______ What you know                    
       
                             *  *  /* /
                           *      /  / *  
                          *      y  /   *____ THE MATRIX
                          *             *
                           *          *   ___ What you don't know
                              *  *  *     

                              Fig. 1

Easier to understand than explain, the Matrix can be described as the 
borderzone between what you know and what you don't (see Fig. 1).  
It can also be thought of as everything that you are not immediately 
experiencing (see Fig. 2)


               You ____________
                               \
        THE MATRIX ________     \                                       
   (taken as read)         \   * \ *   *                               
                             *    \      *                            
                           *______ y      *                                 
      What you see _______ *+++++/        *                          
                           *++++/         *                               
                             *+/         *                                
                               *   *   *                                     
                                                                               
             
                                 Fig. 2
                                         
In this case, The Matrix is all the "given" parts surrounding 
whatever's right in front of you.  For example, although this text is
right in front of you, the author, his computer and typist are something 
you take for granted; something  your mind fills in to account for this 
text's existence.  Since a similar filling-in forms the major part of
what we call "reality", it could be argued that we don't really know what's
going on at all.  THEREFORE:  "Y o u  n e v e r  c a n  t e l l . . . "

And it is just this uncertainty that enables Obscure Reasearch Labs to
have the sort of "fun with the data" that has made us famous and infamous
in weirdological circles and among the gullible.




                        ON GOING PROJECTS AT ORL 

FAR CORNER-- "The Weirdological Bulletin"  This is the Official Publication 
of Obscure Research Labs, published between experiments and filled with news
of whatever it is we do here at ORL.  Subscriptions may be obtained by
sending $2 in cash or stamps (no checks or money orders, please) for four
issues.  Sample copies are 50 cents (overseas subscription please add one
IRC per issue).

THE ARCHIVES-- It is our goal, in conjunction with our purpose of information
storage/retrieval, to obtain one of everything there is.  You can help in 
this worthwhile cause.  Send us anything of interest and we'll tuck it away
"for later."

FACTSHEET DISEMINATION-- From time to time, we at Obscure Research Labs issue
factsheets regarding certain topics of weirdological and general interest.
Write for current list of titles; better still, suggest a topic and we'll
cover it in a future factsheet.

ORL ONLINE-- Our newest technician  N.H. Sparx  has been assigned to 
interpet this planet's electromagnetic communications net.  This document
you are reading is the first attempt on this level of the net.
More transmissions will follow ...
