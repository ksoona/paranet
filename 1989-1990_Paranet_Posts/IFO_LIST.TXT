Many people are surprised to learn that virtually 90% of all UFO reports can 
be and have been explained.  The major argument seems to be over whether the 
remaining 10% is "noise" or "signal".  Herewith, a list of things which have 
been the primary cause of UFO reports in the past.  It's a list that any 
investigator should be aware of when studying a particular report.  It was 
compiled by Donald Menzel, a noted debunker of the 50s and 60s, who 
characterized this list as "minimal and highly abbreviated".  (From "UFOs: A 
Scientific Debate", Sagan and Page, eds. consisting of papers presented at a 
symposium sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science, held in Boston on Dec. 26-27, 1969, ISBN 0-393-00739-1)
