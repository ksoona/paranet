November 11, 1989
     ParaNet  Information Service (Denver, CO)--This evening  saw
perhaps an unprecedented event in UFOlogy.  KLAS-TV in Las Vegas,
Nevada  has  been airing a UFO special during  the  evening  news
which began on Monday dealing with the UFO mystery and  cover-up.
The series, which has been covered by ParaNet, began its coverage
with  a  history of UFOs beginning in the late 1940s  and  moving
forward  through  the  numerous sighting reports  to  the  cattle
mutilations,  which was aired last evening.  As promised  at  the
close of last evening's show, George Knapp, a news anchorman  for
Channel  8  in Vegas, stated that a scientific  person  would  be
featured on tonight's program who has claimed to work at Area 51,
the  government's super-secret test range at Nevada Test Site  at
Mercury, Nevada.
Indeed,  quite a story was told by Robert Lazar, a physicist  who
claimed  that  he had worked on a project at  Area  51  involving
flying disks provided by alien intelligences.
     Over the last year, ParaNet has carried stories relating  to
possible  involvement  with the government in  projects  of  this
nature at the Nevada test site.  Up to now, the stories have been
of a very speculative nature.  Although the material presented by
Robert  Lazar  remains unconfirmed, enough information  has  been
disclosed that ParaNet's large investigative staff in Nevada  has
started an intensive investigation into this release. Both  Lazar
(formerly  known  only  as "Dennis") and Lear  have  appeared  on
Channel  8 -- Lear appearing on numerous occasions together  will
Bill Cooper discussing Lear's famous 'ET Hypothesis.'  On a  past
KLAS-TV  report,  Lear was shown to have  traveled  to  locations
appearing to overlook the test site which purportedly provided  a
good  view of the objects as they flew into the night sky.   Lear
attempted  to shoot video of an object as it  maneuvered  through
the night sky during last summer, however nothing was captured on
the  tape  of a substantive nature.  Lear also relates  that  his
group  was  harassed by a Lincoln County  sheriff  following  his
attempts to take the pictures.
     Below  is  a  transcript  of the  program  that  aired  this
evening.   All paragraphs out of quotes are the narrator  of  the
segment.   We were as accurate as possible on the  transcription,
however  there are a couple of places where comments were  edited
out due to inability to understand what was being said.
     Further  reports  will be provided  as  information  becomes
available.
=================================================================

     We've  been  working  on  the  story  for  some  time....UFO
researchers  claim that there is a secret government  within  our
government.  Now this may be hard to believe coming from the  UFO
perspective,  but  we have learned that Watergate  and  the  Iran
Contra  scandal  that factions within our government can  and  do
pursue  their own hidden agendas outside of the law; outside  the
control of the Congress or the knowledge of the American  people.
This is exactly the type of operation that we hear about tonight.
It's  a  chilling scenario with worldwide implications  that  may
have its roots right here [Las Vegas, Nevada].
     Area 51, that mysterious corner of the Nevada Test Site,  is
no  longer considered a secret.  The fact that  secretive  things
go on here isn't evident; even to the Soviets who make daily  spy
flights  over  the facility to take a peek at  what's  going  on.
These photos, never before shown in public, are about as close as
anyone will ever come to seeing what the place looks like  again.
The dry bed at Groom Lake, the corrugated buildings, a three-mile
long  runway  and some highly sophisticated radar  and  detection
equipment.   Its  been  known by many names  over  the  years  --
Dreamland; The Ranch; The Skunk Works.  If ever there was a place
to  test  the  secret new technology, this  is  it.   And  that's
exactly what has been done here for decades.
     Area  51  is  where Francis Gary Powers and  the  other  U-2
pilots  were trained in the 50s.  And, where the U-2  itself  was
developed.   The SR-71 spy plane that spotted Soviet missiles  in
Cuba  in  the early 60s were also developed at 51.  51  is  where
Stealth  technology  was nurtured, where Star  Wars  devices  are
still tested, and where all manner of CIA [unknown] business  has
been  plotted  and refined.  It's the perfect  place  for  secret
things,  but  of course, that's no secret.  51 is ringed  by  the
forbidden vastness of the Nevada test site; by the looming  Groom
Mountain  and  by sparsely populated desert  expanses.   But  the
people that do live out here have no love lost for the  military,
but  they're  conservative,  patriotic and they  mind  their  own
business.

Interviewer questioning a nearby resident of Area 51:  "Ever  see
something that you can't explain?"

Resident: "Sure, lots of times."

Interviewer:  "Care to elaborate?"

Resident:  "No."  (Laughter).

     On  any given night at the Rachel Bar and Grill,  you  might
find  three or four people who work at Area 51.  They  are  among
the flowing Budweiser and the cowboy hats.  You might find  them,
but  they  are not going to talk to.  Not about the  things  that
they have seen over the mountain.  A steady trickle of curiosity-
seekers  flows through here; strangers, drawn by strange  stories
of lights in the night sky.  Their questions also go  unanswered.
No one who has worked at Dreamland has ever publicly acknowledged
what  so  many  people  have suspected  for  years:   That  alien
technology is being tested in the Nevada desert.
     The speculation first surfaced in documents obtained by  UFO
researchers.  Documents about something called Project  Aquarius.
The document allegedly prepared for an organization called MJ-12,
states  that  a  program to fly recovered  alien  spacecraft  was
established  in 1972 and is continuing in Nevada.   The  National
Security Agency has confirmed it does have a Project Aquarius but
denies that it has anything to do with flying saucers.  NSA  will
not say what Project Aquarius is.
     Speculation  was  heightened  in 1984, when  the  Air  Force
seized nearly 90,000 acres around Groom Lake.  The action was, by
most accounts, illegal.  During Congressional hearings about  the
land grab, Congressman John Siberling grilled the military  about
the legal authority used in the action and was told the authority
was   at  a  much,  much  higher  level  than  the   Air   Force.
Siberling  asked  what authority is higher than the laws  of  the
United States?  The Air Force official said he could respond, but
only in a closed briefing.  In 1987, when the Air Force sought to
renew  its  stranglehold on the Groom range, news  articles  once
again  mentioned the talk about alien spacecraft  and  subsequent
articles  in  national magazines quoted  un-named  sources  about
things of alien origin flying in Nevada.  Things that would  make
film-maker  George Lucas drool.  Despite the speculation, no  one
who  knew Area 51 from the inside ever talked publicly about  the
saucer story.

Bob  Lazar:  "Well, there's several uh, actually nine  uh  flying
saucers,  flying  disks that are out  there  of  extraterrestrial
origin."   The  live  interview with the  shadowy  "Dennis"  drew
international attention.  Portions were broadcast by radio in six
European  countries, and in a nationally televised TV special  in
Japan.
     Despite  numerous  inquiries  and  "feelers,"  "Dennis"  has
remained anonymous until now.  His real name is Robert Lazar.   A
young scientist with eclectic interests.  The choice of  "Dennis"
was an inside joke -- he says that's the name of his superior  at
Groom Lake.  It wasn't a joke to Dennis.
Lazar:   "He called right after and said, 'Do you have  any  idea
what we're going to do to you now?' and I said no, and he hung up
the phone."

     Lazar's  story is by any standard, fantastic.  He says  he's
telling it in order to protect himself.  He said he was hired  to
work in area called S-4 which is a few miles south of Groom Lake.
At  S-4,  he says, are flying saucers, anti-matter  reactors  and
other  working  examples of technology that is  seemingly  beyond
human capabilities.

Lazar:  "Right.  This stuff came from somewhere else.  I know  it
is  hard to believe, but it is there and I saw it.  I  know  what
the  current  state-of-the-art is in physics and it it  can't  be
done."
     Checking  out Lazar's credentials proved to be  a  difficult
task.   He says he holds degrees in physics and electronics,  but
the schools that we contacted say they've never heard of him.  He
says  he  also  worked  as a physicist  at  Los  Alamos  National
Labs  where  he worked with one of the world's  largest  particle
beam  accelerators,  a  half-mile  long  'behemoth'  capable   of
generating  seven-hundred  million volts.  Los  Alamos  officials
told  us they have no record of Robert Lazar ever working  there.
They were either mistaken or were lying.  A 1982 phone book  from
the  Lab lists Lazar right there among the other  scientists  and
technicians.  A 1982 news clipping from the Los Alamos  newspaper
profiled Lazar and his interest in jet cars.  It, too,  mentioned
his  employment at the Lab as a physicist.  We called Los  Alamos
again,  and  an  exasperated official told us  he  still  had  no
records  on  Lazar.   EG&G,  which is where  Lazar  says  he  was
interviewed  for the job at S-4, also has no record.  It's as  if
someone has made him disappear.

Lazar:  "Well, they're trying to make me look non-existent to the
places that I called...."

Interviewer:  "Explain.  Called where?"

Lazar:   "Well, the schools that I went to; the hospital  that  I
was born at; past jobs, and nothing comes up with my name on it."

     He smiles, but out of futility, knowing the whole thing must
sound  ridiculous.   According  to Lazar, his  employer  was  the
United  States Navy.  He says he and other  government  employees
would gather near EG&G, fly to Groom Lake, then a very few people
would get into a bus with blacked out or no windows and drive  to
S-4.

Interviewer:  "You get off the bus, what do you see?"

Lazar:   "A  very  interesting  building.  Its  got  a  slope  of
probably  about  30 degrees which are hangar doors,  and  it  has
textured paint on it, but it looks like sand.  It's made to  look
like  the  side of the mountain that it is in,  whether  it's  to
disguise it from satellite photographs or what...."

     He  says he was never told exactly what he would be  working
on, but figured it had something to do with advanced  propulsion.
On  his first day he was told to read a series of briefings,  and
immediately realized how advanced the propulsion really was.

Lazar:   "The power source is an anti-matter reactor.   They  run
gravity  amplifiers.   There is actually two parts to  the  drive
mechanism.   It's  a bizarre technology.  There  is  no  physical
hookups between any of the systems in there.  They use gravity as
a wave using wave guides that look like microwaves."

     It  took awhile, Lazar says, before he actually saw  one  of
the flying disks, however there were hints everywhere.

Lazar:   "Right.   They  had  a poster,  and  it  looked  like  a
commercial  poster, like it was lithographed, like you could  buy
it  at K-Mart or someplace, but they were all over the place  and
it  had the disk that I coined the term 'the floor  model'  which
lifted  off the ground about 3 feet out at the area, in  the  Dry
Lakes  area,  and the caption on it said 'They're  here.'   These
posters were all over the place."

     Later, he got to see the real thing.

Lazar:  "When I was led in, it was the first time that I saw  the
'floor  model'  in the hangar sitting down, and I was  told  they
could have walked me in the front door but they purposely  wanted
to walk me by it.  I was told not to say anything and to keep  my
eyes  forward and walk past the disk to the office area.   And  I
did.   And as we went by it, I just kinda stuck my hands  on  it,
just to run it alongside the thing and uh ....After that I got to
see actually lift off the ground and operate."

Interviewer:  "You actually got to see more than one?"

Lazar:   "Yeah.  The hangars are all connected  together.   There
are large bay doors between each one.  There were nine total that
I  saw, each one being different.  Like they had  the  assortment
pack."

     Security at S-4 was oppressive Lazar said, and his superiors
used fear and intimidation almost as a brainwashing tool.

Lazar:  "They did everything but physically hurt me."

Interviewer:  "They put a gun to your head?"

Lazar:  "Yeah."

Interviewer:  "You mean they actually put a gun to your head?"

Lazar:   "They did that even in the original  security  briefing.

Guards there with M-16s.  Guys there slamming their fingers  into
my  chest, screaming into my ear, they were pointing  weapons  at
me.  Like I said, it's not a good place to work."

     That  fear  factor  would surface later.   Lazar  agreed  to
undergo a polygraph exam as part of this report.  Polygrapher Ron
Clay asked about the technology that Lazar had seen.

Polygrapher:   "Did you knowingly lie when you had actually  seen
anti-gravity propulsion in operation?"

Lazar:  "No."

     The results of this exam were inconclusive.  Lazar  appeared
to  be  truthful  on  one test;  deceitful  on  a  second.   Clay
recommended  that a second examiner be brought  in.   Polygrapher
Terry Tabernetti (sp?) runs a corporate security operation and is
a  former Los Angeles police officer.  He put Lazar through  four
tests and concluded there were no attempts to deceive.
     Tabernetti sent his test results to a third polygrapher  who
agreed the results appeared truthful.  The charts were then  sent
to  a  fourth examiner who did not agree  suggesting  that  Lazar
might  be  relating information he'd learned from  someone  else.
The  polygraphers  concurred and decided they would not  issue  a
final  statement on truthfulness until more specific testing  can
be conducted.  And that's where it stands.
     Tabernetti  believes the difficulty in  determining  Lazar's
truthfulness stems from the fear that was drilled into him.

Lazar:  "Well, I am telling the truth.  I've tried to prove that.
What's  going  on up there could be the most important  event  in
history.   You're  talking about contact,  physical  contact  and
proof from another planet, another system, another  intelligence.
Thats got to be the biggest event in history, period.  And,  it's
real  and it's there.  And I had an extremely small part  in  it.
I'm  convinced that what I saw is absolute proof of that.   There
is  no way that we could have created those disks.  There  is  no
way  we could have made the disks, the power  supplies,  anything
that goes with it."
     Lazar  says he has no intention of going on any UFO  lecture
circuit.  He is not looking to do any additional interviews.   In
fact, he was not too crazy about doing this one.  He did it after
certain unfavorable things started happening in his life, and  he
did it because he feels that whoever is running the show up at S-
4  is  perpetrating  a  fraud on  the  American  people  and  the
scientific community.

November 13, 1989

     ParaNet   Information  Service  (Denver,  CO)  --   In   our
continuing  coverage of the remarkable revelations coming out  of
Las  Vegas, Nevada, here is the next installment to  the  program
aired  on  November 13, 1989 by television  station  KLAS-TV  and
George Knapp.

=================================================================

News Anchor persons:
     A  former  government scientist has alleged  that  the  U.S.
military is flying recovered UFOs at a secret base in the  Nevada
desert.  The allegations about the secret facility near the Groom
Mountains  first  surfaced  on Eyewitness  News  on  last  Friday
[November 10, 1989].
     Scientist Bob Lazar says that there are at least nine of the
flying  saucers  being  tested and that they were  not  built  on
Earth.   George Knapp has more on the continuation of our  series
on UFOs.

Lazar:   "Yeah.  It was obvious it came from somewhere else,  uh,
other than Earth."

    Scientist Bob Lazar was convinced that the technology he saw
being  tested at a secret base in the Nevada desert is  of  alien
origin,  and for Lazar the proof is, at least, partially  in  the
furniture.   One of the nine flying disks he says he saw  at  the
base,  which  was  designated S-4, looks exactly  like  this  UFO
photographed  in Europe [Photo of UFO shown].   Lazar  called  it
the "sport model."

Lazar:  "I gave everything names -- the top hat one and you  know
the  jello  mold and, uh, the sport model  operated  without  any
hitches  at  all.  I mean, it looked new.  If I knew what  a  new
flying  saucer looked like.  One of them looked like it  was  hit
with  some  sort  of a projectile.  It had a large  hole  in  the
bottom  and a large hole in the top with the metal bent out  like
some  sort  of,  you know, large caliber 4 or  5  inch  had  gone
through it."
     Even  before he saw the sport model operate, Lazar says,  he
suspected   that  the  ship  came  from  somewhere   else.    The
realization  slapped him in the face the first time  he  glimpsed
the inside of the disk.

Lazar:  "I got to look inside and it had really small chairs.   I
think  that  was the first confirmation I had.  That was  just  a
shocking thing because everytime before that I was able to  label
it.  This is just a little advance that a group of scientists had
formed  and,  you know, they're keeping it secret, and  yeah,  we
could  have  built  a big disk like that,  and  yeah,  that's  no
problem, and, you know, we could have adapted the use(?) to  make
it fly, but why does it have little furniture inside?  [garbled].
And things began to click together just all too fast."
     A  few of the disks had been completely dismantled  to  find
out   how  they  worked,  Lazar  says,  but  others  were   fully
operational.  A Japanese TV network created this animated version
of  Lazar's story after his first interview with us aired in  May
[showing  video].  Lazar says the dramatization is similar  to  a
test flight he witnessed.

Lazar:  "The bottom of it glowed blue and began to hiss like any,
like  high  voltage does on a round sphere.  It's  my  impression
that the reason that they're round and have no sharp edges is  to
contain the high voltage like, uh, if you've seen a high  voltage
system's insulators -- things are round or else you get a  corona
discharge.   In either case, it began to hiss as in high  voltage
and it lifted off the ground quietly except for that little  hiss
in  the background, and that stopped as soon as it reached  about
20 or 30 feet."

     Lazar  says the test of the sport model was a short  one  --
that  it  made  only a few moves before setting  back  down.   He
didn't  see  who  was actually flying the  craft,  but  was  very
impressed, nonetheless.

Lazar:  "Well, there's no action reaction system to it.   There's
no,  like  in a jet engine, exhaust gas being thrown  out  --  no
propeller,  no noise.  It's just, for all intents  and  purposes,
magic."
     To  Lazar's knowledge, the flying disks are not being  used,
for  say, any flights to Jupiter.  He said excessive caution  and
intense  secrecy contributed to the plodding pace of the  program
and were a main source of his disenchantment.

Lazar:   "It's just unfair, outright, not to put it in the  hands
of the overall scientific community.  There are people much  more
capable of dealing with this information, and by this time  would
have  gotten a lot further along than this small select group  of
people working out in the middle of the desert.  They don't  even
have  the facilities, really, to completely analyze what  they're
dealing with."

Gene  Huff:  "Well he was being quiet.  If he kept me abreast  of
anything,  he  kept me abreast of the security checks  --  they'd
randomly  drop  by his house.  They'd threaten his  life;  they'd
threaten  his wife's life.  They had done all that so  we  really
didn't converse, I mean, he really was adhering to the program."

     Gene  Huff is a Las Vegas real estate appraiser.  A  regular
guy  who  just  happens to have a friend  in  the  flying  saucer
business.  He learned about Lazar's S-4 experiences only after  a
long period.  Lazar is anxious for people to know that he  didn't
just  run  right out and spill the secrets of the  universe,  and
that some things are properly kept confidential.



Lazar:  "I did not believe that this should be a security matter.
Some  of it, sure.  But, just the concept that  there's  definite
proof, and uh, we even have articles from another world,  another
system, you just can't not tell everyone.  A lot of people  don't
believe that.  But, I do."

     When he reached what he felt was his bursting point, he took
Huff  and a few others to the edge of the Groom Mountains to  see
the  flights  for themselves.  A total of five witnesses  on  two
consecutive  weeks managed to dodge security patrols long  enough
to see the strange glowing object lift above the mountain.

Huff(?):   "Uh,  it came up above the same  mountain.   It  moved
around.   It  did a step move -- it actually went up in  the  air
like  this  [showing  details with hands]  and  it  hovered  then
dropped way down then it just floated around and cruised  around.
It starts coming up the mountain range...."

     This home video tape was recorded during one of the trips to
the   Groom   Mountains   [showing  video   tape.    A   lot   of
talking....Object  in  sight....Mention  of  brightness  of   the
object....].
     Admittedly,  the tape proves very little by itself  because,
with  the distance and darkness,  there are no  reference  points
other than the alleged flying disk, but Lazar's information about
the  time and location of the test flight proves correct  --  not
once  but  twice.  That, according to our  off-camera  interviews
with each of the other witnesses.  Gene Huff describes his second
sighting:

Huff:   "Through the telescope we could see an  elliptical-shaped
light.   You  can only get so close even with a  telescope  to  a
secure  facility.   Anyway, it came up by us  very  rapidly.   It
glowed  and  glows  brighter like a star and we  almost  got  the
feeling that it was going to explode, it glowed so brightly.   We
backed  up behind the car then it went down and glowed back up  a
little bit and then very softly glided back over, back where  the
mountains  where it came up, hovered for awhile, and then  that's
that....Just like you see in the movies."
     Bob Lazar isn't the only person to claim "inside  knowledge"
of  the  flying  disks at the test site -- he is  just  the  only
person  to  say so publicly.  We have communicated  with  several
people who say they know of the saucer program.  A technician  in
a highly sensitive position told us it is "common knowledge among
those  with high security clearances that recovered  alien  disks
are  stored at the Nevada test site."  A Las Vegas  professional,
who  once  served in the military and was stationed at  the  test
site,  said he saw a flying disk land outside the  boundaries  of
Area  51 -- that it was quickly surrounded by security  personnel
and  that he was taken away and debriefed for several  hours.   A
man  who  once  worked  at Groom Lake as  a  technician,  at  our
request, wrote this letter explaining how he inadvertently walked
into  the  wrong  hangar  and saw what appeared  to  be  a  large
metallic disk under a tarp.  It was being examined by men in  lab
coats.   And,  an  airman  who  worked  at  Nellis  at  a   radar
installation  says  he and his fellow servicemen watched  over  a
period  of  five nights, unusual objects flying  over  the  Groom
Mountains.  He says the radar images indicates the objects zoomed
into range at speeds of 7,000 miles per hour and then would  stop
on  a  dime, and that nothing we have is capable of  doing  that.
The  airman says that when word of his sighting got out,  he  was
ordered  to turn off his radar sensors for that area and told  to
keep quiet about the matter because it did not happen.
     None  of  this means that the military  is  actually  flying
alien  spacecraft in the Nevada desert.  It could all perhaps  be
explained as some other secret program.  Lazar insists that's not
the case.
     We  put  the  matter to the U.S. Navy,  which  according  to
Lazar, is running the saucer show.  Four different naval  offices
were  contacted.   All  denied having any  information  in  their
files.   The  Naval  Research Lab said it  conducted  a  thorough
search  but found "zip."  Naval Intelligence said much  the  same
thing,  adding,  it is not required to create a  file  where  one
doesn't  exist.  A side note:  We also requested files on  a  UFO
sighting over Tremonton, Utah in 1952.  The Navy spent more  than
a thousand hours studying film of that sighting -- a fact  that's
been  noted in several publications -- but, for purposes  of  our
request, the Navy couldn't find those files either.

Lazar:   "The group that runs this project, whether it really  is
the  Navy  or they just say that, apparently  these  people  have
executive power -- they don't report to anyone."

     Tomorrow,   more  troubling  allegations  of  the   military
potential of alien technology.

                           GEORGE KNAPP
 Right.
                           CHUCK HARDER
 I  understand  that  you have come  upon  some  very  interesting
 information and you've done some special reports, could you  tell
 us about it...?
                           GEORGE KNAPP
 Well  we  just  finished a nine-part series -- what  may  be  the
 longest series that's ever been done on this subject dealing with
 UFOs.
 Our  research actually started about two and a half years ago,  a
 fellow named John Lear, the son of the guy who invented the  Lear
 Jet brought some of this information to our attention.  In May of
 this year, Mr. Lear introduced us to a fellow who claims to  have
 worked  at a secret base designated S-4...on a top-secret  Nevada
 test  site...the  fellow said that he worked on  flying  saucers,
 that  the technology was not from Earth, and we  interviewed  him
 live  in silhouette in May, the response was incredible...we  got
 response  from Japan, parts of that interview aired on  radio  in
 Europe, and six different European countries...so we decided with
 this much interest we might want to take a look at the subject in
 more depth.

 We  started doing that and the first thing we found out  is  that
  really  UFOs  have  not been given a fair shake  by  science,  by
  government,  by religion and especially by journalism.   Millions
  of  people  have seen UFOs, millions more believe...I  think  the
  latest  Gallup  poll shows about 70 percent  of  college-educated
  Americans  believe that there's something to it, but  because  of
  the tabloid aspects...'The Girl Who Gives Birth to 52 UFO Babies'
  --  kind  of things in the National Enquirer, people  have  shied
  away  from  it...Serious  people have  shied  away.   Scientists,
  although  they might be interested in searching the universe  for
  radio signals really don't want to look in their own back yard --
  they can't get grants...people would laugh at them.  Journalism -
  - the coverage is generally condescending and quirky,  especially
  by  the networks, as in the coverage of this UFO that  supposedly
  landed in the USSR, people making fun of it...so, we figured  out
  that millions of people want to know as Roy Neary, the guy in the
  'Close Encounters' movie said, 'What's going on?'  So we  started
  investigating it.  The focal point of the story being this fellow
  who  said he worked at S-4.  We broke his identity  last  Friday.
  His name is Bob Lazar, he is a former scientist who worked at Los
  Alamos  National  Labs,  he  is a physicist...we  did  a  lot  of
  checking on him and found interestingly enough that his life  was
  disappearing  around  him.  In other words we called  Los  Alamos
  Labs and they said they never heard of him.  We called MIT  where
  he  says he went to school and they had never heard of  him.   We
  called  for  his Birth records and they had  disappeared...as  if
  someone  was  trying to make him a non-person.   We  did  however
  confirm  some of the information that he had given us...we  found
  newspaper articles from Los Alamos indicating that he had  indeed
  worked  there...we found an old telephone book from the lab  with
  his name in it, which gave him a certain amount of credibility in
  our eyes.  The story he tells is an incredible one.  He was hired
  to work at this area called S-4 on the test site, he was flown up
  to  a place called Groom Lake -- taken by bus with no windows  to
  S-4...the  base  is  built almost to look like its  part  of  the
  desert  with  sand covered hanger doors, he goes  inside  and  he
  starts reading these briefing papers dealing with UFOs!  Pictures
  of  UFOs  on the walls, pictures of aliens,  autopsy  reports  on
  alien bodies...things of this nature -- he's pretty amazed.  Then
  he sees the discs.  He says there are nine of the discs up there,
  they are powered by an anti-matter reactor which produces its own
  gravitational  field...technology  that does not  exist  on  this
  planet,  and the interesting thing...he thought for a while  that
  perhaps  it was just an advanced secret scientific  project  that
  our  government  is pursuing until he looked inside  one  of  the
  discs and noticed the small furniture...all the chairs were built
  like  for children...and then things started coming together  for
  him.  Are you with me Chuck?
                            CHUCK HARDER
  I'm listening.
                            GEORGE KNAPP
  Er, I'm not sure how much detail you want me to go in on...
                            CHUCK HARDER
  Oh I think you ought to keep going.
                            GEORGE KNAPP
  Well, this fellow was up there for only a few months.  And it was
  a  rough place for him to work...the security was so hard and  he
  was  being harassed at home, his phones being tapped...plus  he's
  on to what he thinks are the secrets of the universe...he  starts
  to tell other people about it, confide with close friends.
                             CHUCK HARDER
  Ummmmmm.....
                            GEORGE KNAPP
  He  had  the  date of a couple of tests and  on  two  consecutive
  weekends  he  took  people  up into the  desert  outside  of  the
  boundaries  of area S-4, and they video taped the  saucers...what
  looks like a saucer coming over the mountains!
                             CHUCK HARDER
  Wow...
                            GEORGE KNAPP
 We showed that video as well...
                            CHUCK HARDER
  Uh-huh....
                            GEORGE KNAPP
  Five different people that we interviewed that had gone up  there
  confirmed the same story...we also had confirmation of other bits
  of  his  story  from other people, a former  security  guard  who
  worked  up  there...who said he had seen the  saucers,  a  former
  technician...
                             CHUCK HARDER
  By  the  way,  excuse me, I have some letters  from  some  people
  postmarked  from  that area, one inside of a base, who  tells  me
  what you're saying is true.  Keep going.
                             GEORGE KNAPP
  Ah,  we also found a Nellis Airman who had been on radar duty  at
  Nellis  airbase  which is here just south of the area  that  this
  fellow is talking about...he reported numerous times seeing...
                            CHUCK HARDER
 George,  excuse me...let me do the half hour news break,  I  want
  you to tell your story, I want America to hear it...please  stand
  by.
  >>>>At  this point the SUN RADIO NETWORK runs the half hour  news
  headlines and sports audio package from UPI<<<<
  (After news the guest is re-introduced for listeners who may have
  just tuned in...)
                            CHUCK HARDER
  How many reports did you do, George?
                            GEORGE KNAPP
  We did nine total in this series.
                            CHUCK HARDER
  Ok, now at the time we went to news on the half hour you told  me
  that a scientist named Bob Lazar...
                            GEORGE KNAPP
  Right...
                            CHUCK HARDER
  Ok,  came  to  you  and came to the  public  and  apparently  was
  concerned for his safety because he wanted to tell America or get
  news out that - yes, the Federal Government has nine saucers, and
  yes they are near...it's near Nellis, is it not?
                            GEORGE KNAPP
  Yes.
                             CHUCK HARDER
  Cause  I  have letters from people who are at  Nellis.   Some  of
  which  don't  want to give their name, some of which  gave  their
  name, I have the postmarks.  Tell us now if you would, start  the
  story  from the fact that the gentleman has revealed  that  there
  are nine of these things.  We're listening and so is America.
                            GEORGE KNAPP
  Well,  we  wanted  to  try to confirm as much  of  his  story  as
  possible from other sources of course, so we started looking  for
  other  people  who  might have knowledge of what's  going  on  up
  there...as I mentioned, I found a former security guard who  said
  that  he  had  seen  the  saucers up  there,  I  found  a  former
  technician who said that he had walked into a room  inadvertently
  and saw one under a tarp, we found a Nellis airman who had worked
  in  radar  and said that basically he and his fellow  airman  has
  seen these things flying over the Groom Mountains at speeds up to
  7,000  miles  per  hour on radar...these things would stop  on  a
  dime,  so  the  guy knew that this is not your  average  airplane
  that's doing this.  We also interviewed the other people who went
  with  Lazar  up  on  two consecutive weeks,  they  test  them  on
  Wednesdays for some reason,  and videotaped the tests,  saw these
  things flying over the mountains and confirmed his story as well.

  We put these questions to the Navy, who Lazar says he worked  for
  up  there  --  we made Freedom of Information  Act  requests  for
  information about the various specific programs he mentioned,  of
  course  the Navy denied having any information on  the  programs.
  Of  course in those requests we also asked for other  information
  about  UFOs, stuff the Navy has already released and they  denied
  having that information as well -- so I don't put a lot of  faith
  in the FOIA requests.

                            CHUCK HARDER
   In  other  words, what you're saying is  that  your  organization
   which  is  KLAS-TV  in Las Vegas, plus many  other  UFO  research
   groups  have  uncovered many UFO documents  that  the  government
   says, 'Yeah, we got them and yeah it's true'...but then when  you
   ask them again they say, 'No, we don't have them!'
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Exactly...that's exactly correct!
                               CHUCK HARDER
   I  understand  from MUFON and many other groups  that  there  are
   somewhere  from  four  to seven  thousand  documents  that  prove
   that...yes  these  things exist, copies of the documents  are  in
   private  hands, then you go and ask the government and they  say,
   'Well, er, no we don't remember...'
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   The  government says that they have done these studies  that  say
   that  UFOs  are no threat to national  security,  they're  either
   psychological aberrations, which means that people are nuts  when
   they see them, that's what they feed the public...but behind  the
   scenes  they  are  very concerned  about  the  national  security
   implications of UFOs that land at nuclear missile bases and can't
   be  caught, things of that nature.  So the government  from  what
   I've  read  is  very concerned about the  phenomena  and  doesn't
   really  understand  it.   The government on the  other  hand  has
   outright lied concerning what information it does have...the  CIA
   for   example  says  it  doesn't  collect  any   information   on
   UFOs...well  that's  just patently not true.  We  have  documents
   from  the  CIA, a lot of it is blacked out,  which  mentions  UFO
   studies  by  the  CIA,  UFO  research,  CIA-UFO  experts,  agency
   personnel who are monitoring the phenomenon, so they have lied to
   us all along.  I didn't expect to get any confirmation  regarding
   what Lazar has to say, but had to give it a try anyway.
                             CHUCK HARDER
   Before  we  went  to the half-hour break you said  that  when  he
   looked  inside  one of these discs there were  little  furniture,
   give me some information...
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Well  he  feels that they were bringing him along, giving  him  a
   piece  at  a time.  He would see a saucer one day,  the  next  he
   would see the hanger doors open and see all nine of  them...after
   that he got to see the inside of the thing.  He also got to see a
   demonstration  of  it.   He  was told to  stand  back  and  watch
   this...and  the thing lights up real bright...I guess  the  power
   that's  produced  is  incredible, you need to  produce  your  own
   gravitational  field  and it raised up, he wasn't  sure  who  was
   flying  it or was it remotely or what.  He watched it  raise  up,
   did a couple of maneuvers and sat back down.  Part of the  reason
   he came forward, not to spill the secrets of the universe or  the
   government,  but because the research that's being done up  there
   is being handled in a clumsy fashion.  If they have had these for
   as  long as forty years, which is what he believes, they  haven't
   come  to far in trying to understand them.  Some of the discs  he
   said  he saw up there were being taken apart, kind of  a  reverse
   archaeology  process to figure out how they worked.   Some of the
   research  going on up there is aimed at trying to  duplicate  the
   things  that  these machines can do using earth technologies  and
   earth  materials and he says it just can't be done.   The key  to
   the flying of the things is something he calls 'Element 115'...it
   does not exist on our periodic charts,  he believes that wherever
   it came from its a naturally occurring element,  he says we  have
   500  pounds of this stuff up there,  just a little tiny sliver of
   it produces incredible amounts of power.   Its the '115' that  we
   will  not be able to duplicate so he thinks...one of the  reasons
   that he came forward is because scientists all over the world are
   working,  putting  their energy into trying to master the secrets
   of  gravity  and the secrets of anti-matter technology  and  here
   we've got it up there and they're not doing a very good job  with
   it  -- this  little batch of scientists hidden out in the  desert
   are trying to figure it out and not doing a very good job...
                             CHUCK HARDER
   But this is kind of common with the United States  government...I
   read a tremendous amount of material...I read a tremendous amount
   of  material...I read five newspapers a day and I'll  find  where
   one group in one part of the country is working on a project  and
   I'll  get a clipping where another group is working on  the  same
   project, I've contacted them and they don't know of each other!
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Yeah,    Yeah   --   that's   exactly   right...he    said    the
   compartmentalization  up  there was very severe as well  so  that
   nobody had the full picture -- I guess so nobody could spill  the
   beans as he has been trying to do.
                             CHUCK HARDER
   Alright,  what does he feel the public should know and what  does
   he feel should be done?
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Well, he's not on a campaign, what he really wanted to do was  to
   save  his  own  life.  He started having some  problems  when  it
   became obvious to his employers that he was telling someone  else
   about this.
                            CHUCK HARDER
   We're talking about Bob Lazar now...
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Bob Lazar...his phone being tapped, people visiting him,  calling
   him  up with a single word message -- DEAD -- then they hang  up!
   He  tried to arrange meetings with his former supervisor and  the
   meetings didn't come off,  he says somebody took a shot at him on
   the freeway...obviously he realizes that if they really wanted to
   kill  him,  they could.   Maybe perhaps they were just trying  to
   shut him up.   He feels that what is going on up there is a crime
   against  the entire scientific community...not only the  American
   people because we don't know what's going on and we haven't  been
   told  alien  technology exists,  but also against the  scientific
   community.  So, what else can I tell ya?
                               CHUCK HARDER
   What does he say about the aliens?
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   He's  reluctant  to talk about that, apparently he did  see  some
   aliens up there...
                             CHUCK HARDER
   Excuse me, are you telling me there were live aliens?
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Yeah,  he's kind of sketchy on the details of that, and  I  don't
   think  I should go much further on that...part of the  discussion
   until  I can talk to him, but he has indications that  there  are
   aliens up there, at least one...
                             CHUCK HARDER
   Live?
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Yeah,  it's pretty wild, I know and I didn't include that in  our
   reports  because I couldn't confirm any thing of that  nature,  I
   couldn't find anyone else who had seen them up there so...
                             CHUCK HARDER
   What did they look like?
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Your  classic  Grey...the  little  big-headed  almond   eyed-grey
   skinned being...the same ones in the classic descriptions of  the
   UFO literature...he's kind of squeamish talking about it as  well
   because it sounds so crazy...
                             CHUCK HARDER
   I  don't  think it's crazy at all, there was an article,  let  me
   digress for a moment, there was an article yesterday on the front
   page of The Wall Street Journal where the FDA that stopped all of
   the grapes from Chile last March...apparently somebody laced  two
   of  the  grapes with cyanide a couple of hours  before  the  FDA,
   stumbled  on them and it was an inside job apparently  while  the
   grapes  were in the inspection station...and it was not  done  on
   the way, so somebody's lying there -- we're talking of two little
   grapes  that  almost  bankrupted the country of  Chile!   If  two
   little grapes...and such a story hits the front page of The  Wall
   Street  Journal  about the questions about the  truthfulness  and
   what happened with the FDA, what about this...how would this ever
   get out if they would cover up a story about TWO LITTLE GRAPES?!
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Well,  I tell you we asked the question, the obvious question, if
   this is true;  how can the government keep this a secret all this
   time?   A  story this big -- the government leaks like a sieve on
   other things, how could the coverup exist?
                               CHUCK HARDER
   Oh, I'll tell you...
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   To  which Lazar responds, this is the easiest...and he asked  the
   question to his superiors up there, it's the easiest thing in the
   world  to keep a secret because if it does come out, little  bits
   and pieces, who's going to believe it?
                             CHUCK HARDER
   Exactly...let me, you remember the Condon Report, do you not?
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Yes...
                             CHUCK HARDER
   For  those  who  are listening, I  got  into  this  investigation
   because I kept getting letters from our listeners who said, Chuck
   you ought to investigate this...we've investigated many things in
   the  past such as the GM Diesel coverup, we're working on  a  pay
   phone  coverup, we've done things with Ralph Nader...and  so  on.
   So we started buying the books and contacting UFO  organizations.
   I then found that there was a guy named Phil Klass who was always
   there...somehow  he as always there and he said  that  everything
   was bunk!  And of course, he works for the Aviation Week magazine
   which is of course is the mouthpiece for the  Military/Industrial
   complex  and they certainly wouldn't want this technology  to  be
   out!   I  was also amazed when I saw the stealth  bomber  (tests)
   live  on  CNN one Saturday and a small plane landed at  the  same
   place, (runway) do you remember that...?
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Yes...
                             CHUCK HARDER
   My  question is:  If the Stealth Bomber was so super-secret,  how
   could a man and his children land their little tiny plane on  the
   same  runway at a super-secret airforce base?  How could he  have
   pierced the radar and fighter jets and so forth?  My feeling was,
   probably the Stealth Bomber was obsolete and nobody was watching!
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Yeah,  I'd  have  to  agree with you,  because  the  security  up
   there...the only thing that comes out of that place is what  they
   want out of it.
                             CHUCK HARDER
   So what your talking about then, since the Condon Committee, Phil
   Klass  and all the of the spokespeople who are supposed  to  know
   everything,  what your saying is the ridicule  factor...if  Billy
   Bob sees a flying saucer and even has a photo of it and takes  it
   to the paper, everybody laughs at him!
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   There  are  actual documents the government has  released  (Under
   Freedom  of Information Act) that show it has an  active  program
   that  started  back in the fifties...the CIA even used  the  term
   DEBUNKING,  there  were discussions about using  Walt  Disney  to
   produce  cartoons  that made fun of people who  had  seen  flying
   saucers...they  were  going to bring Arthur Godfrey in  as  their
   spokesperson.   Phil Klass as you mentioned, he's explained  away
   UFO  sightings seen by thousands of people as  the  constellation
   ORION,  when  you can only see ORION from the other side  of  the
   planet.
                             CHUCK HARDER
   Uh huh...
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   He  uses things like Ball Lightning, plasma balls to explain  the
   sightings where plasma balls only last for a few seconds and  the
   examples  that he is trying to explain occur in  cloudless  skies
   where  there  is  no lightning around.  You  mention  the  Condon
   report, that's a perfect example of the kinds of things that  the
   government  has done in the past, they commission a  study,  it's
   supposed to be THE STUDY, but the guy they hire to run the thing,
   Edward Condon had before he even started, that there was  nothing
   to UFOs, the government should get out of it, and he also said at
   one  point that the authors of UFO books should be  HORSEWHIPPED!
   One  of  the  explanations that came from  the  Condon  Committee
   witnessed  by  several people, they described it  as,  a  natural
   phenomena so rare that it has never been seen before or since!  I
   don't think this kind of a thing is an accident!
                             CHUCK HARDER
   Ok,  the Soviet Union and Tass gave their report (of a  UFO)  and
   from what I have heard there are different kinds of aliens,  some
   have been coming here for years and years and it's nothing new...
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Right...
                             CHUCK HARDER
   Why  is  it  in some parts of the world (now) they  report  other
   types of humanoids and other types of vehicles...I happen to have
   beautiful photos of some,  and as I told you  off-the-air,  we're
   going  to be releasing them in our upcoming magazine  if  someone
   doesn't stick a dagger through my heart...
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   You're  talking about the Billy Meier case,  if you want to touch
   on that, we also did some investigation on that...
                             CHUCK HARDER
   Ok, go ahead.
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Billy Meier,  I've always been intrigued by that,  and wanted  to
   check  them  out.   Its been pretty much written-off by  the  UFO
   community  but when we put questions to them about the case  they
   can't explain exactly why so we traveled to Phoenix and talked to
   Lee  Elders one of the lead investigators on the Billy Meier case
   and  started  going  over the  evidence.   The  photos  had  been
   analyzed  by independent experts,  the film footage and video had
   been  analyzed,  the metal sample had been confirmed as something
   we  don't have -- technology of cold fusion was used  to  produce
   this metal,  the landing sites,  the strange circular patterns in
   the  grass  that  are now only gaining attention in  Britain  and
   other  countries,  all of this stuff had never been  pretty  much
   discounted  by  the  UFO community because  Elders  and  Wendelle
   Stevens   had   gone  outside  of  the  UFO  community   to   get
   confirmation.   The  UFO  people were kept out of it,  the  Billy
   Meier  case I think exemplifies the biggest weakness  in  UFOLOGY
   and  that's  the  jealousy that permeates  the  field...everybody
   wants  to be the only one with the real story of  UFOs,  so  they
   kind  of  written this guy off only because he  didn't  cooperate
   with them.
                             CHUCK HARDER
   We  have been able to get some photos from a source who has  some
   negatives  that  were just recently located...some from ten  feet
   away,  I used to be in the motion picture business.   If they are
   models  they  cost thousands of dollars and I doubt if  a  simple
   Swiss farmer could have done it...
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   I'd agree with ya,  the reason we got interested in Billy  Meier,
   it  goes back to Lazar,  was because Bob Lazar says,  the  saucer
   that  he  saw fly,  he dubbed it the sport model,  was  the  same
   saucer in the Meier photos, exactly the same.
                             CHUCK HARDER
   The new ones or the old ones?
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   The new one.
                             CHUCK HARDER
   Ok, that's the one we've got.
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Going  back to the things he saw (Lazar) at S-4,  he saw the nine
   saucers, he said all nine of them were different, like we got the
   variety  pack,  but  the one he saw fly was like the one  in  the
   Meier  photo.   (There  are  Three types  photographed  by  Billy
   Meier.)
     That's  why we decided to check out the Meier part of  the  (UFO)
   story.
   >>>>At this point Chuck Harder tells George Knapp that there is a
   break coming up and after the break would he please tell Mr.  and
   Mrs. America what they should do to get the truth.<<<<
                             CHUCK HARDER
   I  hope that Mr.  and Mrs.  America make note of the name  George
   Knapp and Bob Lazar so that if anything ever happens to them, you
   know why.
                             GEORGE KNAPP
   Someone  should  tell  us what's going on...TV  and  movies  have
   conditioned  us...we  won't panic...Jimmy Carter when he ran  for
   President  promised that if he was elected that he vowed to  open
   all the UFO files and he didn't -- we wrote to him asking why and
   he  didn't respond.   We want the government to come  clean.   If
   that  takes a Congressional Investigation...that's something that
   should be looked at.  If it is launched we have to make sure that
   there  are no CIA,  contractors and the like  involved  otherwise
   people  aren't  going to believe it.   We've seen enough of  this
   whitewash stuff over the years.  If there's nothing to the story,
   then open up the files and prove it to us!
                             CHUCK HARDER
   OK,  have the government let the press into these areas and don't
   first clean them out...

    George Knapp:
    Hello, and welcome to On the Record.
    One month ago, we began a series of reports about UFOs.  With the
    exception of a few cranky newspaper people, the response has been
    overwhelmingly positive.  We've had requests for more information
    from  all over the country and from all over the world.   Tonight
    we're  going to delve a little deeper into the subject  with  the
    man  who was the impetus for our report in the first  place,  Bob
    Lazar.
    Bob,  good to have you here.  A thumbnail sketch of yourself  for
    those who might not be familiar with your background.
    
Robert Lazar:
    I worked at Los Alamos National Lab.
Knapp:
    As a physicist?
Lazar:
    As a physicist, and hired as a senior staff physicist at Area  S-
    4, for what I was told anyway was the United States Navy.
Knapp:
    Where is S-4?
Lazar:
    It's  about 10 to 15 miles south of Groom Lake, about  125  miles
    north of Las Vegas.
    
Knapp:
     How did you get the job?
     
Lazar:
     I really don't want to mention the guy who I got it through.  But
     I  was  referred to a person at EG&G to drop off  my  resume  to;
     that's  where  I was interviewed; though the  job  is  COMPLETELY
     unrelated to EG&G.
Knapp:
     What  did they tell you you were going to be doing?  Or DID  they
     tell you?
Lazar:
     No,  they really didn't tell me until the very end.  They said  a
     high-technology job, something that I'd be very interested in.
Knapp:
     Okay, so you get hired.  And what happens?  Do you fly up there?
Lazar:
    Fly  up there.  First day was reading briefings and that sort  of
    thing.   And it became evident to me pretty quickly the level  of
    technology they were dealing with:  gravitational propulsion  and
    things that science has really only barely touched on.
Knapp:                                                    
    We'll  get into the things that you saw in a couple  of  minutes.
    But  it's  been about a little more than three weeks  since  your
    identity was made public.  We had you on another program a couple
    of  months  ago  --  using an assumed  name  and  having  you  in
    silhouette  -- but since your identity has been made  public  and
    since this information has been made public, what's it been like?
    What's been the response from people that see you on the street?
Lazar:
    The  response has been almost all favorable.  In  fact,  everyone
    that I've run into has been very supportive, very interested.   I
    guess there's just two or three letters --
Knapp:
    -- from people that don't believe you?
Lazar:
    Yeah.  Essentially.
Knapp:
    Responses from other media outlets as well?
Lazar:
     Yeah.
Knapp:
    They want to interview you?  What do they want?
Lazar:
    Essentially everything, yes.  Radio interviews, TV interviews.  A
     lot  of people want to dig back into my background  and  re-trace
     everything.
Knapp:
     Many of the people who have been calling -- calling us as well --
     were under the impression that either you've gone underground  or
     you've been silenced or we've been silenced by dark and  sinister
     forces.  Anything like that happen to you so far?
Lazar:
    That's ridiculous.  People are always going over the deep end  on
    that.   And no one's told me -- other than originally --  not  to
    say anything.  And I'm sure no one's come forward to you.
Knapp:
    But in the beginning, they told you to keep quiet about this.
Lazar:
    Oh yeah!  It's the most secret program in the United States.
Knapp:
    In what way did they try to make sure you kept your mouth shut?
Lazar:
    Everything up to death threats.  I mean CONSTANT reminders of it,
    signing  away  my constututional rights for fair trial  and  that
    sort of thing.
Knapp:
    And since this thing, your phone's been tapped, you believe?
Lazar:
    Yeah, I believe.  I have a tap detector, and occasionally after I
    pick up the phone, a little red light goes on.
Knapp:
    The  reason you came forward with the information to begin  with?
    Is it related to the fact that they were bothering you?
Lazar:
    Yeah, it was essentially to stop that.  What had happened was,  I
    sent in a request for my birth certificate, and as it turned  out
    it wasn't there anymore, that I wasn't born at the hospital!  And
    that  kind  of  got me wondering what's going on.   I  put  in  a
    request  for some other information, previous jobs, and that  was
    also  gone,  and  I thought something had to  be  done  before  I
    disappeared.
Knapp:
    The same thing -- it was Los Alamos? They've never heard of you?
Lazar:
    Yeah.
Knapp:
    Anything happened since the reports have aired?
Lazar:
    They let me know that they were around by doing stupid,  childish
    little things.  But nothing serious, no.
Knapp:
    You  were  worried  about your LIFE though  for  a  while  there,
     weren't you?
Lazar:
    That was one of the reasons to come on and let everything out  on
    the air; it's a little of insurance.
Knapp:
    Are you worried any more?  Do you get the feeling you're over the
    hump?
Lazar:
        To some degree, yeah.
Knapp:
     Do you find that most people really believe you or that they just
     want more information?
Lazar:
    I  think alot of people believe what I said, but the  majority  I
    think  do  just  want more information, too.   It's  an  in-depth
    subject.
Knapp:
    Let's look at some of the technology you saw.  When did you first
    get  the  idea,  what's the first thing you  saw  that  made  you
    convinced that it's not from here?
Lazar:
    The  first  thing was HANDS-on experience  with  the  anti-matter
    reactor.
Knapp:
    Explain what that is and how it works and what it does.
Lazar:
    It's a plate about 18 inches in diameter with a sphere on top.
Knapp:
    We  have a tape of a model that a friend of yours made.  You  can
    narrate along.  There it is.
Lazar:
    Inside  that  tower  is a chip of Element 115 they  just  put  in
    there.  That's a super-heavy element.  The lid goes on top.
    And  as  far as any other of the workings of it, I  really  don't
    know, you know, [such as] what's inside the bottom of it . . .
    115  sets up a gravitational field around the top.   That  little
    wave guide you saw being put on the top:  it essentially  siphons
    off  the  gravity wave, and that's later amplified in  the  lower
    portion of the craft.
    But just in general, the whole technology is virtually unknown.
Knapp:
    Now we saw the model.  We saw the pictures of it there.  It looks
    really, really simple, almost too simple to actually do anything.
Lazar:
    Right.
Knapp:
    Working parts?
Lazar:
    None  detectable.   Essentially, what the job was  was  to  back-
    engineer everthing, where you have a finished product and to step
    backwards  and find out how it was made or how it could  be  made
    with earthly materials.  There hasn't been very much progress.
Knapp:
    How long do you think they've had this technology up there?
Lazar:
    It seems like quite a while, but I really don't know.
Knapp:
    What  could you do with an anti-matter generator?  What  does  it
    do?
Lazar:
    It converts anti-matter . . .
    It   DOESN'T  convert  anti-matter!   There's   an   annihilation
    reaction.  It's an extremely powerful reaction, a hundred percent
    conversion  of  matter  to energy, unlike  a  fission  or  fusion
    reaction  which is somewhere around eight-tenths of  one  percent
    conversion
    of matter to energy.
Knapp:
    How does it work?  What starts the reaction going?
Lazar:
    Really, once the 115 is put in, the reaction is initiated.
Knapp:
    Automatic.
Lazar:
    Right.
Knapp:
   I  don't  understand.   I  mean, there's no  button  to  push  or
   anything?
Lazar:
    No, there's no button to push or anything.
    Apparently,  the 115 under bombardment with protons lets  out  an
    anti-matter particle.  This anti-matter particle will react  with
    any  matter  whatsoever,  which I imagine there  is  some  target
    system  inside  the reactor.  This, in turn, releases  heat,  and
    somewhere  within  that system there  is  a  one-hundred-percent-
    efficient thermionic generator, essentially a  heat-to-electrical
    generator.
Knapp:
    How  is this anti-matter reactor connected to gravity  generation
    that you were talking about earlier?
Lazar:
    Well, that reactor serves two purposes; it provides a  tremendous
    amount  of electrical power, which is almost a  by-product.   The
    gravitational wave gets formed at the sphere, and that's  through
    some action of the 115, and the exact action I don't think anyone
    really knows.
    The  wave  guide  siphons  off  that  gravity  wave,  and  that's
    channeled above the top of the disk to the lower part where there
    are  three  gravity  amplifiers, which amplify  and  direct  that
    gravity wave.
Knapp:
    In essence creating their own gravitational field.
Lazar:
    Their own gravitational field.
Knapp:
    You're  fairly convinced that science on earth doesn't have  this
    technology  right  now?  We have it now at S-4, I guess,  but  we
    didn't create it?
Lazar:
    Right.
Knapp:
    Why not?  Why couldn't we?
Lazar:
    The technology's not even -- We don't even know what gravity IS!
Knapp:
    Well, what is it?  What have you learned about what gravity is?
Lazar:
    Gravity  is  a  wave.  There are many  different  theories,  wave
    included.   It's been theorized that gravity is  also  particles,
    gravitons, which is also incorrect.  But gravity is a wave.   The
    basic wave they can actually tap off of an element:  why that  is
    I'm not exactly sure.
Knapp:
    So you can produce your own gravity.  What does that mean?   What
    does that allow you to do?
Lazar:
    It  allows you to do virtually anything.  Gravity  distorts  time
    and  space.  By doing that, now you're into a different  mode  of
    travel,  where instead of traveling in a linear method  --  going
    from Point A to B -- now you can distort time and space to  where
    you essentially bring the mountain to Mohammad; you almost  bring
    your destination to you without moving.
    And since you're distorting time, all this takes place in between
    moments of time.  It's such a far-fetched concept!
Knapp:
    Of  course, what the UFO skeptics say is, yeah, there's life  out
    there  elsewhere  in the universe; it can never come  here;  it's
    just  too darn far.  With the kind of technology  you're  talking
    about, it makes such considerations irrelevant about distance and
    time and things like that.
Lazar:
    Exactly, because when you are distorting time, there's no  longer
    a  normal reference of time.  And that's what producing your  own
    gravity does.
Knapp:
    You  can go forward or backward in time?  Is that's  what  you're
    saying?
Lazar:
    No,  not essentially.  It would be easier with a model.   On  the
    bottom  side of the disk are the three gravity generators.   When
    they  want  to travel to a distant point, the disk turns  on  its
    side.  The three gravity generators produce a gravitational beam.
     What they do is they converge the three gravity generators  onto
    a point and use that as a focal point; and they bring them up  to
    power and PULL that point towards the disk.  The disk itself will
    attach  ONTO  that point and snap back -- AS THEY  RELEASE  SPACE
    BACK TO THAT POINT!
    Now  all this happens in the distortion of time, so time  is  not
    incrementing.  So the SPEED is essentially infinite.
Knapp:
    We'll get into the disks in a moment.  But the first time you saw
    the  anti-matter reactor in operation or a demonstration  --  you
    had a couple of demonstrations -- tell me about that.
Lazar:
    The  first time I saw it in operation, we just put -- a friend  I
    worked with, Barry -- put the fuel in the reactor, put the lid on
    as, as was shown there.
    Immediately, a gravitational field developed, and he said,  "Feel
    it!"   And  it  felt like you bring two like poles  of  a  magnet
    together; you can do that with your hand.  And it was FASCINATING
    to do that, impossible, except on something with great mass!  And
    obviously this is just a . . .
    And it was a REPULSION field.  In fact, we kind of fooled  around
    with it for a little while.  And we threw golf balls off it.  And
    it was just a really unique thing.
Knapp:
    And you had other demonstrations to show you that this is  pretty
    wild stuff, right?
Lazar:
    Yeah,  they  did.  They were able to channel the field off  in  a
    demonstration  that they created an INTENSE  gravitational  area.
    And you began to see a small little black disk form, and that was
    the bending of the light.
Knapp:
    Just like a black hole floating around?
Lazar:
    Yeah, well, a black hole is a bad analogy, but yeah, essentially.
Knapp:
    And  they  gave  you  some  kind  of  demonstration  about  time,
    involving a candle?  Explain how that works.
Lazar:
    Yeah,  they took a candle and lit it and put it in the  distorted
    gravitational  field,  which distorts time, and the  candle  just
    stood   there.    It  didn't  melt  or  burn.   It   was   REALLY
    unbelievable!
Knapp:
    You had to be floored by seeing all this.
Lazar:
    Oh  I was!  That's why I'm kind of laughing about it now  because
    it must sound ridiculous to everyone.  But it's just  phenomenal.
    I mean this is really alien technology.
Knapp:
    About the 115:  We talked a little bit about it in the series  of
    reports.   Explain what it is again and why you believe it  could
    not be manufactured here.
Lazar:
    Okay,  it's a super-heavy element:  On the periodic chart,  which
    lists   all  the  elements  found  on  earth  and  that  can   be
    synthesized,  I think the highest element we've  synthesized  has
    been about Element 106.
    Now from 103 -- or actually, anything higher than plutonium up --
    the  half-life  begins  to  drop; in  other  words,  the  element
    disintegrates.  When you get up to Element 106, it's only  around
    for  a very small amount of time.  Even science  today  theorizes
    that  up around Element 113 to 116 -- somewhere in there --  they
    should  again become stable.  This is in fact true.  That's  what
    Element 115 is; it's a stable element.
    To  synthesize  it would be impossible.  The  way  we  synthesize
    heavy  elements  is,  we take a stable element  like  bismuth  or
    something  like  that,  or plutionium, whatever,  put  it  in  an
    accelerator,  and  BOMBARD  it with  protons.   Essentially  what
    you're  trying  to  do  is plug in protons  into  the  atoms  and
    increase  the atomic number.  To do that to the level of  Element
    115  would just take an infinite amount of power and an  infinite
    amount of time.
Knapp:
    What  kinds  of things, what capabilities would a  heavy  element
    like this have -- I mean other than producing power?   Obviously,
    it can produce a LOT of power, right?
Lazar:
    It  in itself is not anti-matter.  It just has a unique  property
    of  producing  it.  Any of the other basic properties  it  has  I
    really  don't know of.  But using just the  anti-matter-producing
    property,  the  potential  for  a  weapon  is  staggering!   It's
    absolutely staggering!
Knapp:
    Like what?  A pound of it:  what could it do?
Lazar:
    Well,  2.2  pounds  is the energy  equivalent  of  47  10-megaton
    hydrogen  bombs.   I mean, it's a good bang!  And a  pound  of  a
    super-heavy element is maybe the size of a plum or something like
    that.
Knapp:
    I  guess what I've heard most from people who just don't buy  the
    whole  story is that sure, maybe you work at an area called  S-4,
    and  maybe it is a secret area, but what you were shown is  stuff
    that  we've made.  That we made this 115 -- if it is 115 --  that
    we  made  the  flying  disks,  that  we  made  these  anti-matter
    reactors,  because  these are advances that you just  don't  know
    about.
Lazar:
    Hardly.
    [Lazar laughs.]
Knapp:
    Why not?
Lazar:
    Well,  the 115, it's impossible.  And the FACT that the main  job
    of  everyone there is to find out how everything's made;  I  mean
    that  just  contradicts  everything  right  off  the  bat.    The
    materials  are completely alien to us, and just the overall  idea
    of  the  project is:  Hey, can we duplicate this  with  materials
    that we have here?  So obviously, it was something that was found
    or given, for that matter, and we're just trying to duplicate it.
Knapp:
    The  115:  Where do you suppose it came from then?  I mean,  what
    kind of environment would that kind of element come from?
Lazar:
    The  only  place  that 115 could be made would have to  be  in  a
    natural situation, somewhere maybe on the fringes of a  supernova
    or  somewhere around maybe a binary star system, where there  was
    more  mass  in the primordial mix of that system,  where  heavier
    elements  would  have had a chance to form, when the  stars  were
    collapsing and there were huge amounts of energy being  released.
    It's  something  along  these lines; it has to  be  a  naturally-
    occurring element.
Knapp:
    You  saw  an  anti-matter reactor.   You  saw  gravity-propulsion
    systems  in flying disks, flying saucers.  You saw  this  Element
    115.   You also read a series of reports that had other  stunning
    information.  Can you give an overview of the kind of things that
    were in these reports?
Lazar:
    The  reason I didn't do that before was, first of all  they  were
    just reports.  Everything else I had hands-on experience with.
    Now  there  was LOTS of strange information in the  reports,  but
    there   again  it's  just  printed  material  and  it  could   be
    disinformation.  I don't know.  But certainly, the information  I
    did read in the reports about 115, the disks, the grav -- I mean,
    that all had material that related to that.
    
    The  reports  went into aliens and even went along the  lines  of
    religious --
Knapp:
    Well,  we can let our audience know.  I mean we  discussed  this,
    when we were putting this series of reports together, whether  to
    get  into the alien thing or not, and we decided not to  for  the
    time  being.   It's  not like you're hiding  something  from  the
    audience  or whatever, it was just a decision we made.   But  you
    did  see  reports -- whether they're true or  not  --  Government
    reports about aliens.
Lazar:
    Yeah.
Knapp:
    What were the reports?
Lazar:
    There  were photographs of aliens.  There were  autopsy  reports.
    There was really a wealth of information.
Knapp:
    What did they look like?
Lazar:
    The typical "grey."  I hate to say that, like anyone knows what a
    typical  grey is.  It's a creature, probably three and a half  to
    four feet tall, a large hairless head, black, slanted eyes,  long
    arms, very thin-looking.  I don't know how else I would  describe
    them.
Knapp:
    What  does  an autopsy report look like?  What's included  in  an
    autopsy report that you said you read?
Lazar:
    The reason I call it an autopsy report is I saw the carcass -- it
    was obviously a dead alien -- carcass cut up and it was all  dark
    inside  like  it  had an iron base.  The reason  I  say  iron  is
    because  it was very dark blood or whatever.  I'm not  a  doctor,
    but  it  seemed to be one large organ in the body as  opposed  to
    identifiable heart and lungs and that sort of thing, but just one
    gooey mess in it.
Knapp:
    What  did the report say?  It had pictures; it had to  have  some
    words:  "Here's Exhibit A, an alien"?
Lazar:
     Essentially  so!  They had weights and densities of  the  organs,
     said  there  were no conclusions drawn, but it was just  a  basic
     description of what the person who was cutting open the body saw.
Knapp:
     Say where they came from?
Lazar:
    Yeah,  in one of the reports it said they came from Reticulum  4,
    was what it said.
Knapp:
    Where is that?  Any idea?
Lazar:
      [Lazar laughs.]
      Well, I'm told it's a star system in Zeta Reticuli.  Reticulum is
      the constellation.
      And by "Reticulum 4," they meant the fourth planet out from  that
      sun.
      In  the  same reports, we were identified --  instead  of  saying
      Earth,  we were identified as "Sol 3," meaning the  third  planet
      out from our sun.
Knapp:
    Now  you've  read a lot of UFO material.  Do  you  find  yourself
    mixing what you've read and what you've learned from up there?
Lazar:
   No,  that's why I stay away from the UFO researchers  and  things
   like  that.  I really don't want to be associated with  that.   I
   don't research the stuff.  It's interesting to read, but no,  I'm
   not mixing anything that I've read into this stuff.
Knapp:
   We were just talking about the UFO field in general, and you feel
   a little reluctant to get mixed up in it, although you ARE  right
   now.
Lazar:
    Unfortunately, yeah.
Knapp:
    Why the reluctance?
Lazar:
    I  don't  know.  There are so MANY  stories  circulating  around.
    Everyone has their own view.  Each UFO researcher says they  have
    the  right  story.  And essentially, I don't want  to  side  with
    anyone  because I don't know where that information's come  from,
    though  they  do all have the basic story:  you know,  there  ARE
    alien crafts here; how they got here is, probably aliens  brought
    them here, unless we really have a neat setup with the UPS.
    There's   just   so  many  different  factions   of   them   [UFO
    researchers],  and  they all kind of war between  each  other;  I
    really don't want to get associated with them.
Knapp:
    Before  you  got  into the program at S-4,  though,  you  had  an
    interest  in  UFOs.  It must be hard for people to  swallow  that
    here's a guy who has an interest in it and he gets hired into the
    program.
Lazar:
    Well, there was a very brief time there I had sent out resumes to
    several  places,  and I wanted to get back  into  the  scientific
    field  again.   Almost simultaneously, I met John Lear  and  read
    some  of  his  material.  And initially, I thought  he  was  just
    absolutely  crazy.  But apparently, he did have a good source  of
    information  because,  as it turns out, some of  the  information
    that he had I actually had hands-on experience with.
Knapp:
    But  your  regard for UFOs in general:  As a scientist,  did  you
    think there was something to it?
Lazar:
    Absolutely not.
Knapp:
    Absolutely nothing?
Lazar:
    No.  I would have stood on that 'til the day I died.
Knapp:
    Many  of the people who have been calling are UFO groups  or  UFO
    researchers  who have demanded that you talk to them:  We've  got
    to talk to this guy; we want to give him a lot more publicity  so
    he stays alive; we want him to give us information so that we can
    further  check out his background, etc.; we want to protect  him;
    we want to help him.
    You've resisted.  You've done this program; you've done a  couple
    of  reports  with  us; and you've done a radio show  or  two;  in
    general,  you've  resisted going into the UFO  circuit.   Why  is
    that?
Lazar:
    Just like I mentioned before:  I just don't want to be associated
    with those guys.
    
    And  how many people are you going to open up your background  to
    and let them run rampant through it?  I mean, private detectives,
    every UFO group in the world wants to do that!  The idea was  for
    me to release the information, essentially to protect myself  and
    take  some of the heat off.  And I've done that.  And that's  all
    that needs to be done, really.
Knapp:
     Certain  UFO researchers claim they've been  getting  information
     from  you all along; you've been leaking stuff to them; and  that
     they've  read these reports that verify the information.   You've
     been working with UFO groups while you were in the program at S-
     4?
Lazar:
    Not UFO groups.  I did mention a couple of things to some people.
    That's all I'm gonna say.
Knapp:
    Okay.   In essence, were you breaking your vows that you made  to
    the Government?
Lazar:
    Yeah.
Knapp:
    And  why  did you feel that was necessary?  I mean, you  took  an
    oath, didn't you?
Lazar:
    Yeah.  But look at the magnitude of what was going on.  I believe
    that  some  of the technology -- maybe all of the  technology  --
    should be kept secret, until we have a handle on everything.  But
    certainly, the overview of what happened just cannot be a  secret
    from anyone -- not just the American people, but the rest of  the
    world.
    Let  out  the basic fact that we have these craft,  at  one  time
    aliens  did at least visit and drop off something,  however  they
    got  here,  that  there was some contact made, and  then  cut  it
    short.  You don't need to release the information on the  gravity
    generators,  the weapon potential -- which is enormous -- and  so
    on.
Knapp:
    What could you do with that technology?  Say you took the  flying
    disks, the anti-matter reactors, the gravity generators, gave  it
    to  Los  Alamos  or Livermore, let  them  examine  the  potential
    abilities  of this stuff.  I mean, how would this affect life  on
    earth if this stuff was widely available?
Lazar:
     And mass-producable?
Knapp:
    Yes.
Lazar:
   That's  tough  to say.  I mean, you have a  completely  different
   mode of travel.  What happens when you can play with time?   That
   gets into a really deep philosophical question there.
Knapp:
    But I mean, it would change a lot of stuff, change everything.
Lazar:
    Oh yeah!  It would change absolutely everything!
Knapp:
    Do you think it will ever come out?
Lazar:
    Personally, no.
Knapp:
    What  do  you  hope happens, both with  yourself  and  with  this
    information?
Lazar:
    There's been enough thorns put in their toes to where they do try
    and release something.
Knapp:
    We'll have to have you come back, Bob.  Thanks for joining us.
