Rumors  have  begun  to surface about a group of hackers who were involved in a
project  to  uncover  information  regarding  the  existence of UFOs.  The most
public  example  pertaining to this alleged project was seen on Dateline NBC on
the screen of the mystery hacker "Quentin."

The  story  goes  that this group of individuals decided to put their skills to
work  on  a  project  that,  if successful, would add legitimacy to the hacking
process by uncovering information on what has been called the greatest cover-up
in  the  history  of  the  world.   Milnet  TAC  ID cards were obtained through
military  officials  sympathetic to the cause.  Several sites and networks were
targeted  that  had  in the past been linked to UFO activity.  These were sites
like  the  Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Sandia Labs, TRW Space Research, American
Institute  of  Physics,  and various other educational, government and military
sites.

The  rumors also emphasize that several sites had what these individuals called
"particularly heavy security." Within several seconds after connection had been
established,   system  administrators  of  sites  used  in  this  project  were
contacted.   Further  rumors  state  that  there  was  information  regarding a
propulsion  system  designed  utilizing what is termed "corona discharge" being
analyzed  at  one  site.   The  most  sinister  of  all  rumors states that one
particular  participant  who  was  allegedly  deeply  immersed in TRWs internal
network  has not been heard from since uncovering data regarding a saucer being
housed at one of their Southern California installations.

Believe  what  you  will  about  the  reality  of  this  project.  Much will be
dismissed  as  hacker  lore, but within the core of every rumor lies a grain of
truth.

Are  we  being  lied  to?  Why is this information still classified by the NSA?
What  are  they  hiding from us behind a maze of security?  Will we continue to
stand idly by and let an uncaring and deliberately evasive government shield us
from  what  may  be  the  most  important, and potential dangerous news to ever
surface?   Information  wants to be free, and only a concerted group effort can
make  this  happen.   How  much do you really want to know about what is really
going on?

What follows is information that has been released regarding this project...

These are the raw data.  Where comments are appropriate, they
will be included.  The data will be grouped together with dates,
names etc. to make correlations easier.

There are countless references to the aliens, their down space
craft and what the Government is doing with them. If, as is
supposed, the research on the craft and the 'ufonauts' continues
today, then undoubtedly there are computer records, somewhere.
