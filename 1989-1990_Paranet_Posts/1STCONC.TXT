to them, but simply because they had been conditioned to accept the
positivity of this experience. It was simply a source of great
excitement. There was no resistance whatsoever. There was no fear, and
no arguments between individuals in their society.

         Was there verbal contact in stage three before physical con-
         tact occurred?

No.

         So stage two, which was purely visual, went right into stage
         three by the very act of a ship landing around the people and the
         occupants walking out and physically meeting the people on the
         planet?

Yes. Remember that stages one, two and three are superimposed over
each other. During stage two, stage one is still occurring. They are
not replaced by each other. So when stage two begins, the imaginative
processes, the fiction, is still occurring. In this process they've
already imagined the contents of the ships and the nature of the
entities. Thus when the ships land in stage three, there is no
surprise or fear. There is only acceptance and excitement.

It is kind of like being a Native American civilization and knowing
that just over the ridge there is another community because you can
see their smoke signals. You know they are there. Sometimes you send
smoke signals back and forth to each other. But the day you meet is a
celebration. Anything further on Alpha-3?

         It seems pretty cut and dried. It is nothing like what occurs
         here!

Some of these stages occur here, but because of the level of
resistance that your planet has, these stages have had to be al-
tered. The resistance your planet is experiencing comes from your
thousands of years of intermittent extraterrestrial contact as a
primitive species.

         BETA-4

Now then, we will share with you information about a culture that we
will call Beta-4. Beta-4 is a civilization whose genetic connections
are Vegan in nature. Their resistance to ET contact was very, very
strong. They have a lot of fear. Let us give you their background.

Beta-4 began as a penal colony. There were no prison structures
built; instead they were simply abandoned there. They were not left
with a lot of equipment or knowledge. After a period of time they
degenerated somewhat. Their population grew very rapidly and segmented
itself. They later came together and began forming a planetary
identity.

When they came together, they retained no knowledge of their origins
except through mythology. However, there was an underlying emotional
memory that was a reaction to the abandonment they had experienced as
the early penal colony. This created in them an unconscious desire to
have nothing to do with those who abandoned them.

After thousands of years of evolution, they developed a society that
utilized technology. When they were approaching planetary
consciousness, they then began to question the idea of whether to
build devices to take themselves off the planet. The species pain was
still there concerning their abandonment, so the drive to go back
out into space was not strong. They had an intense curiosity to see
what was out there, but at the same time the pain they felt thinking
about it kept them from building any machines to take them off the
planet.

Using the garden-hose analogy, because they were unwilling to look
at this pain, they formed a blockage. This blockage stopped the
natural flow of species evolution. The inhabitants of Beta-4 were
ready at this point to be indoctrinated into the galactic community.
The extraterrestrials who began coming to their planet knew it would
be challenging to assimilate that planet to the greater reality. They
knew there would be resistance.

The extraterrestrials began simply by flying ships into areas where
there were many people. The ships were never seen. Their focus in
perception was so tight that the Betans literally could not perceive
the reality of these ships.

This was a period when there was still alot of conflict going on
between the Lyran and Vegan empires. The extraterrestrials who were
attempting communication with Beta-4 were aware that there was a
possible threat coming because of these conflicts. It was imperative
that contact be made. However, they tried many different ways to make
contact but were unsuccessful. They tried landing; they tried
approaching people. What ensued between the extraterrestrials and
the Betans could be compared to a comedy on your world. It was as if
they could not speak the same language. Any conversations made
between these ETs and the Betans created total, absolute confusion.

From the point of view of the Betans, they were being talked to by a
member of their own race. This member somehow was not able to
communicate clearly. The Betan would simply walk away in confusion.
The Betans would not see these ETs as being anything other than
members of their own race. It was total limited vision. These
